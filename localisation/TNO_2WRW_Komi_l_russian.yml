 POLITICS_ALEXEI_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "In 1918, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich was shot several times by soldiers of the Red Army and was left for dead along with his family in a house in Yekatarinburg. Alexei, protected by Gods grave and a shirt wrapped in previous gems beneath his tunic, survived and fled the city.\n\nFor the past 4 decades, Alexei had become a wanderering traveller, seeking comfort at the bottom of a bottle. Even when the Nazi's had taken over Mosocw, Alexei remained hidden.\n\nThings have changed. The rise of the mad regent who somehow knew he had lived was destorying his native country. Alexei had seen what the Regent has done to his homeland, the thousands that were slaughtered in the name of purifying the nation for the return of the Tsarevich. There seemed to be only one way to stop this madman once and for all. Russia will have it's Tsar."

 TSAR.1.d:0 "Why do I still live? What more do you want from me? I gave everything I had to you, to them. Look what they've made of our dream. This bloated, rotting carcass of an empire is driven not by reason and hope but by fear, hate and ignorance. Better that we had all burned in the fires of Hitlers ambition than live to see this.\n\nWe failed father. You failed your sons and we in turn failed you. And now to compound our arrogance and vainglory we have failed all of them too. Did the Bolsheviks not say you sought godhood? They built their rebellion on that claim. Oh how they would gloat and laugh at the state of Russia now."
