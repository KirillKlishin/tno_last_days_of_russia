  vyborg_border_conflict.1.desc:0 "The city of Vyborg was won by the Soviet Union back in 1940 when Red Army troops triumphed over the Finnish troops. Although the city was eventually retaken by Finland during the Great Patriotic War, many of our Generals believe that with [195.GetName] back in the hands of the [RUS.GetName], we should put some distance between Finland and [195.GetName] and retake what is rightfully ours."

  vyborg_border_conflict.3.desc:0 "Despite the efforts of the Army, the Finnish defence has held and routed our forces. With Vyborg firmly in Finnish hands, their government has not only demanded we relinquish our claims to the reigon but also demanded we demilitarise [195.GetName]. With much of Russia exhausted from decades of warfare, our top advisors have urged the government to accept peace and to focus on rebuilding the naiton."
