 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_AVERIN_DESC:0 "О, слушатель, узнай же рассказ о том, как после падения Советского Союза и его армии, когда Россия стала походить на звёздное небо, где каждая звезда – воюющее государство. Вологда, Онега, Архангельск, Коми сейчас словно образуют созвездие с военными демократиями в их главе; Самара и Вятка, где осели вшивые патриоты под немецкой пятой, а за Уралом таких государств и сосчитать нельзя. Но всех их своим дурным светом озаряет Московия, только одним своим существованием унижающее достоинство советского народа. Но сюда, на покорённые земли, пришёл Николай Степанович Аверин из города Горький, озлобленный, хлебнувший горя, вооружённый до зубов, вор, опустошитель, убийца, полный амбиций о том, чтобы уничтожить нацистов в Московии мощью своих танков.\n\nБудучи видным мастером по устрашению в Западной России, Аверин впервые заимел дурную славу среди немцев во время Западнорусской Войны, ведя в бой самую свирепую танковую армию под командованием Ворошилова. В те дни хаоса, что наступили после войны, Аверин сумел собрать те остатки бронетанковых сил, что ещё были способны сражаться, под городом Горький, яростно сражаясь с вермахтом, стоя до последней капли крови, последней машины, дабы дать отступить оставшиеся советские войска. После же падения ЗРРФ, Горький остался стоять один, а с ним остался и Аверин.\n\nСпустя года, танки Аверина одновременно сильны и слабы. Чтобы оставаться на плаву, его войска вынуждены совершать набеги на немецкие земли, чтобы пополнить запасы боеприпасов, топлива и заключённых. Однако новая жизнь рейдера пришлась по душе Аверину, потому его идеология отошла на второй план, отдав приоритет новой страсти  - уничтожению немцев, усладе от их криков и плача немецких женщин!"
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_KATUKOV_DESC:0 "Михаила Ефимовича Катукова можно заслуженно считать гордым советским солдатом. Он – верный советской идеологии солдат, а не бандит-предатель, что раньше были его сослуживцами. Он - выдающийся танковый офицер со времён Великой Отечественной Войны, он первым прославился в таком далёком и таком трагическом сорок первом году, когда сдержал наступление немецкой танковой дивизии под Тулой, чем и удивил её командующего Хайнца Гудериана. Но сила воли одного человека –  не спасение для всего Союза от угрозы нацистской твари. Союз пал, но Катуков сдаваться отказался, и продолжил бой.\n\nВместе с генералом Авериным он возглавлял танковые клинья в пору Западнорусской Войны, что впоследствии выбило немцев от Горького, но не дало должных результатов из-за вмешательства коллаборационистов, разорвавших связь Горького с Архангельским Генштабом. Его войска оказались изолированными в городе Горький. Пока люди Аверина нашли спасение в пиратстве и дебоширстве, Катуков с его людьми стояли поотдаль от них, ожидая момента для удара.\n\nКогда же бандиты были готовы пойти на уступки новой буржуазии, старый советский генерал смог выйти из тени, чтобы вновь послужить Советскому Союзу. Собрав всех лояльных ему лиц, помнящих о былом прошлом, Катуков смог сменить капиталистическое слабое правительство, дабы вновь поднять Красное Знамя над городом Горький. И оно никогда более не будет опущено, ни один бандит, враг Родины или ревизионист не посмеет его опозорить, пока живы верные сыны Родины!"
 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_KATUSHEV_DESC:0 "Как и жизни большинства жителей города, жизнь Константина Фёдоровича Катушева была связана с Горьковским автозаводом. Всё детство он прожил рядом с ним, его отец работал на нём почти всю свою жизнь. Никто не был удивлён, когда Константин стал ведущим инженером ГАЗ, проектируя новые, более совершенные модели машин.\n\nПравда заключалась в том, что ему не нравились те, на кого он работал. Танковые налётчики Аверина не годились для умного и тихого человека, такого как Катушев, как и для роли новых правителей города. n\nОднако же Северорусская Республика смогла найти идеальное сочетание из стабильности и возможностей ГАЗ-а, чем не мог гордиться Катушев, что смог наконец руководить не столько отдельным заводом, сколько всем остальным городом, принося прибыль Республике и двигаясь к достижению мечты своей жизн."

 CHU_securing_the_factories_desc:0 "Заводы – жизненная сила нашей военной машины. Без них нам не выстоит против немецких захватчиков. Наш гордый лидер Аверин, главнокомандующий всеми бронетанковыми войсками, подчеркнул важность поддержания  хорошей оборонительной силы, не смотря ни на что, ведь бомбардировки до сих пор продолжаются. Пока идут бомбардировки, мы всё ещё в опасности.\n\nЗахват ещё большего количества заводов, что находятся под контролем бандитов, и последующей перестройке производства на военный лад – идея нашей страны. Это позволит  нам продолжать набеги, дабы не дать умереть городу Горький."
 CHU_move_it_underground:0 "Под землю"
 CHU_move_it_underground_desc:0 "Every day, hundreds of German bombers set out from their bases to fly eastwards, their goal being solely to destroy any hint of civilization in free Russia. Being right across the demarcation line of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, Gorky is a prime target, and when we have to develop our industry, it can be quite challenging. However, some commanders and economists who want to prevent this issue have suggested a groundbreaking solution: to move our industry underground.\n\nBy constructing or relocating machines and production lines deep beneath the ground, in basements and tunnels, we will not have to worry about them being destroyed by the bombs. It will not be an easy process, since this has rarely been tried before, but the people of Gorky must show their dedication and help the city become better through their work and support of Averin's leadership."
 CHU_work_at_night:0 "Под покровом ночи"
 CHU_work_at_night_desc:0 "The daily bombing runs the Germans conduct do not occur all the time. They start early in the morning, as the sun comes up, and only end when the dark has engulfed our country. This, a seemingly unimportant detail, could be a key factor in maintaining and increasing our production if we use it to our advantage.\n\nInstead of working an 8-hour shift in daylight, the workers of the city will work shifts in the night. When the skies are silent, they will head to the factories and help the war effort until the morning comes. This way, they will be free to work normally, and with no fears of a Luftwaffe airplane destroying the building, and they will pave the road for new raids and attacks."
 CHU_obscure_facilities:0 "Туманные предприятия"
 CHU_obscure_facilities_desc:0 "The Germans may have destroyed our houses and our shops, but we can still take some actions to prevent them from bringing more destruction upon Gorky and Russia as a whole. Aside from what we've already done, there is yet another measure to be taken, and that is to hide our factories in plain sight. When the bombers fly over a factory that produces arms and tanks, they are far more likely to bomb it than an innocent shack or a farm. If we are able to trick the Germans, then our military industry will be able to operate under the radar much better.\n\nThus, normal buildings like houses, shops and warehouses, that would otherwise be left untouched in most cases, will be secretly re-purposed to produce and funnel weapons to our tank army that occupies Gorky. The civilians will surely see the value of this project, and join the effort."
 CHU_homes_for_the_workers:0 "Дома для рабочих"
 CHU_homes_for_the_workers_desc:0 "While we have toiled endlessly to move arms production away from the watchful eyes of German bombers, we have neglected our responsibility to the people who make our factories run. The Reich destroys endlessly, indiscriminately; civilian lodgings are just as likely to be targeted as military installations, and many in areas under our control have found themselves homeless as a result of repeated bombardment.\n\nLuckily, the ethical solution for this issue is also the practical one. Making our workers' homes one with their workplaces will make it far easier and safer to staff our facilities, and better for morale to boot. In Gorky, we take from others far more often than we give to them; providing shelter for civilians is a rare mercy, and one to be cherished."
 CHU_keep_it_discrete:0 "Держать в содержании"
 CHU_keep_it_discrete_desc:0 "Ever since we have relaunched our tank production and began launching raids into the Reichskommissariat, the Germans have focused their hateful eyes on us more than almost anyone else in west Russia. Every structure in the Gorky area has faced some sort of attack; they have terror bombed our factories, our villages, our meeting places, and our markets. This constant threat of death from above has made life extremely difficult for ordinary people.\n\nOur only real option is to frustrate every effort of the bombers to destroy our facilities and menace our people. Since we can't shoot them down, the best strategy is deception; from so high up, a camouflaged building is indistinguishable from a stretch of landscape. As bandits, we have always had a problem with popularity; showing Gorky's citizens that we want to defend them will do wonders for our reception among the populace."
 CHU_paint_fake_villages:0 "Потёмкинские деревни"
 CHU_paint_fake_villages_desc:0 "Ever since the Great Patriotic War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia has been an intelligence black hole from the perspective of the rest of the world. Most of the time, this is a problem; international aid, for example, is unknown for all but the largest warlords. When it comes to German bombings, however, the one-way fog of war has been useful. The Reichskommissariat's dearth of relevant information makes picking out logical targets very difficult, and oftentimes target lists are decided by whichever settlement looks the most threatening.\n\nWe can exploit their ignorance for our own purposes. Erecting model villages that appear strategically valuable will direct the bombers away from our much humbler genuine settlements. We may be brigands, but we are not monsters, and keeping the destruction of our towns at a minimum is a high priority."
 CHU_fake_facilities:0 "Ненастоящие фабрики"
 CHU_fake_facilities_desc:0 "As we continue building up our industry, dealing with the issue of German bombing is necessary if we want to succeed in a reasonable time frame. Our factories, as the engines of our rearmament, are constantly under assault from the forces of the Reich. Thankfully, the West Russian War has given us a great deal of experience with quick reconstruction of such buildings, but this eats away at our time and resources. Stopping the Germans from bombing our factories in the first place would be ideal.\n\nOne way to accomplish this goal is to simply construct fake factories. We can easily begin constructing model warehouses and factories for a relatively low cost, and the benefits from not having to interrupt production every time a bomb hits will quickly show themselves. We live and die by the strength of our weapons program; keeping them safe from bombardment is of the utmost importance."
 CHU_we_pulled_it_off:0 "Мы справились!"
 CHU_we_pulled_it_off_desc:0 "After embarking on our ambitious program to divert as many bombs away from our homes and factories as possible, we have not been able to do much other than wait and pray. If our ruses had not worked, we would have built model structures and camouflaged our real production for naught, as bombs still pulverized our infrastructure. Thankfully, the Germans were exactly as stupid as we assumed. All across our territory, the Reichskommissariat's forces rain hell on plaster and wood facsimiles, while our real places of habitation and production sit safely beneath notice.\n\nAfter years of devastation, order has finally returned to Gorky. Our people can live without the fear of being killed at any moment. Our factories continue to churn out weapons and equipment, and our operations against the Reich can finally begin in earnest."
 CHU_the_fake_market:0 "Неправильный рынок"
 CHU_the_fake_market_desc:0 "We have largely financed the continued upkeep of our tank force by the sale to whoever needs them of goods seized from Reichskommissariat Moskowien. The Reich disapproves heavily of our kind of commerce and has given special attention to annihilating any location they imagine we are using for such purposes with copious amounts of heavy ordinance. For obvious reasons, it is difficult for us to convince potential trade partners to meet when the venue is at constant risk of being destroyed.\n\nWe have already made use of fake buildings to keep the Germans bombing the wrong targets before; creating fake markets should be a simple task. The cost of building fake stalls and meeting places is dwarfed by that of the German bombings, and our customers will surely appreciate the extra concern."
 CHU_careful_raids:0 "Аккуратные Набеги"
 CHU_careful_raids_desc:0 "It is an open secret between the warlords and the German rulers of Moskowien that the borders that separate the Reichskommissariat and the shattered remnants of the Soviet Union are more formal than real. Large, and therefore expensive to maintain, the Germans are often stretched too thin to respond to incursions to their border, lightly defending it unless in cases of full-scale attacks. Even then, the tired fascist war machine could ill muster resistance for long.\n\nTo us, this fact of lethargy and neglect is the perfect opportunity to launch raids of our own. The porous frontiers, with gaps in German attention, make it simple for us to punch through using armored concentration. Once inside the Reichskommissariat, our objective would be to steal equipment as well as to note the road layouts and size of German forces. With that done, the officers can use the reports to try and improve our combat performance."
 CHU_salvage_the_battlefield:0 "Трофеи с поля боя"
 CHU_salvage_the_battlefield_desc:0 "The Germans and their weak, underequipped militia and garrison divisions have failed to stem the tide of our armor. In their haste to flee the field, they have left behind their troop encampments and border guard posts. These teem with machine guns, rifles, and ammunition. Seeing as the fascists do not want these back, shown by their seeming reluctance to launch counter-attacks, we would hate to waste such a thoughtful gift from a dear friend.\n\nWe will task our soldiers to salvage duty. These troopers will plunder and strip clean all weapons and bullet cartridges from a site, making sure all that is useable belongs in our hands. Another team will follow them, tracking routes in the terrain that the trucks can tread through. These German guns, while outdated and handed out only in desperation, will be useful to us. It is now time for the Nazis to have a little taste of their own lead."
 CHU_loot_the_bodies:0 "Обыскать тела"
 CHU_loot_the_bodies_desc:0 "As our engagements with Moskowien continue, with us scattering their thin and undertrained forces to the winds, our troops have begun to notice the strange behavior of the Germans. The Aryan ideal of the farmer-peasant lie lifeless in droves, abandoned and unburied. True to their barbaric and cowardly nature, the Nazis have left the dead behind, their personal belongings nothing more than trash attached to a body.\n\nHowever, as the saying goes, "another man's trash is another's treasure." These contain a range of items that we sorely lack: personal radios, wristwatches, alcohol, as well as fancy uniforms that can be torn apart and turned into bandages. As the Germans are not too keen on having these back, we will send squads to loot and scavenge the sites of our battles to recover as much as possible. We can then redistribute these among the troops, to each according to his ability."
 CHU_maintenance_companies:0 "Обслуживание компаний"
 CHU_maintenance_companies_desc:0 "Tanks are expensive death machines. Unfortunately for us, they are also fragile. Composed of various complex moving parts, one small malfunction in a multitude of systems can grind a tank to a halt, or else render it useless where it matters the most. A breakdown in enemy territory would mean the crew would have to abandon it, as the pace of the attack cannot wait for these tanks to catch up. A wasteful but common practice, this has lost us precious manufacturing time and raw materials.\n\nThe officers have brought up the idea of maintenance companies to our attention. These are units tasked to go down and up the line, given parts and mechanical tools to repair tanks and get them back in working order. With these instated, supplied, and trained, our offensives would retain their momentum, and the armored wave will not cease from beating back the enemy."
 CHU_search_for_survivors:0 "Поиск выживших"
 CHU_search_for_survivors_desc:0 "In times of intense combat as our raids into Moskowien, it is impossible to account for everyone. The lists of our soldiers that go missing, whose deaths are unconfirmed, grow day by day. Although they are more likely than not to be dead, the survivors are a constant source of concern. These men carry with them information regarding the composition of our forces, the direction of our attacks, our commanding officers, and such. If they fall into German hands, a weak-willed comrade is bound to spill.\n\nTo prevent this, we will dispatch scouts and light infantry into the Reichskommissariat, casting a wide net over areas of conflict. Their task would be to rescue any trooper stranded deep within German territory and return them to us safely. They will also extend this treatment to any Russian they can find. Anyone that we can save is a comrade in the struggle against the fascists."
 CHU_getting_the_artillery:0 "Артиллерия у нас"
 CHU_getting_the_artillery_desc:0 "With the supplies and equipment our German friends have kindly gifted to us, as well as intelligence from the survivors regarding weak points along their lines, we have never looked stronger. The maintenance companies are operational, and tank losses due to non-combat issues are shrinking. The stage is set for Averin's next heist into Moskowien, to steal something our army has lacked all this time: artillery.\n\nThe plan is simple: exploit their gaps and burrow deep into their territory, encircling isolated units along the way. This time, however, we will not be sated by mere camps and border outposts. Our tanks will use their speed and power to punch a hole through their divisions into their armories. Meanwhile, the motorized wing of our army will rip out their artillery pieces, placing them at our disposal. We will deprive them of every advantage, and etch fear into their hearts."
 CHU_german_tanks:0 "Немецкие танки"
 CHU_german_tanks_desc:0 "The raids we have launched into fascist lands have brought into our possession a few modern German tanks. Obviously we would be able to design better ones given proper equipment, but for now they're the best we have. Before we use them, however, they must be repaired and refitted to our standards. Their armament - both the main cannon and coaxial machine gun - will be swapped out for our own models that we can regularly supply with ammunition, and an engineer has proposed replacing their engines as well.\n\nOnce the refits are completed these will become the pride of our glorious tank fleet, and it will surely come as a shock to our enemies when they see their own panzers being used against them! In particular, Averin himself has been eyeing the finest example we got our hands on for potential use as his personal vehicle."
 CHU_new_anti_tank_guns:0 "Новые ПТО"
 CHU_new_anti_tank_guns_desc:0 "Our latest raid came across a battery of new German anti-tank guns. They were easily dispatched, of course, but it seems that the fascists have finally decided to heed the might of Gorky. While the guns themselves aren't particularly useful to us given their lack of mobility, several of our engineers have begun shooting and picking them apart to reverse-engineer. This will demonstrate to us their capabilities and allow us to develop countermeasures for when we inevitably see the Germans deploy them in larger numbers.\n\nThose aren't the only possibilities for these weapons, either. We could begin manufacturing our own, improved versions to put into the turrets of our tanks, or use them in their original form in the unlikely event that Gorky itself comes under siege."
 CHU_tank_destroyers:0 "Уничтожители танков"
 CHU_tank_destroyers_desc:0 "Dedicated self-propelled anti-tank guns fell out of use following the Second World War, but that doesn't mean the idea of sticking a big gun onto a low chassis is still without merit. In particular, we have several turretless tank chassis rusting in our scrap yards that could easily be restored to operational status. One of our engineers has suggested we put these to use, mounting them with large-calibre guns in casemates and sending them on raids alongside our tanks as experimental units. There we will determine their effectiveness as well as develop the methods with which they will be used.\n\nIf their performance proves satisfactory, several of our assembly lines will be switched over to their production and more units will be created. If not, the hulls will be sent back to where they came from having served their purpose in a worthwhile, if not exactly fruitful, experiment."
 CHU_battle_of_saransk:0 "Битва за Саранск"
 CHU_battle_of_saransk_desc:0 ""It seems we've really pissed the fascists off this time! Our scouts report that a large force of German tanks is being assembled across our border in Moskowien, preparing to launch a punitive expedition into Gorky. Little do they know that they are the ones who will end up under attack! Averin has ordered every one of his tank crews to mount their vehicles and prepare to move out in the largest force we have ever assembled, and what is shaping up to be one of the largest tank battles since the West Russian War. Morale is high and the men are eager to deliver a crushing blow to our enemies, for once we are victorious they will have free reign to loot at their leisure for at least a month.\n\nDefeat is, of course, out of the question - we are the finest practitioners of armored warfare in the world, and there is simply no way we will end up losing against a bunch of scared conscripts hiding within their metal boxes!"
 CHU_steal_their_planes:0 "Украсть их планы"
 CHU_steal_their_planes_desc:0 "One lesser known fact about the Germans' decades-long bombing program against the people of Russia is the massive burden it puts on their logistics. A huge network of factories, hangars, and military installations ensures that the Reich is able to launch missions anywhere in west Russia on short notice. Sometimes, they get overconfident, leaving us a great opportunity.\n\nIn their infinite wisdom, the Germans have established a forward air base not far away from the Reichskommissariat's border with our territory. It is stocked with some of the most modern fighter jets available, and the classic German tendency to underestimate "subhumans" means that its guard detail is a skeleton crew. In other words, a cache of modern planes is ripe for the taking. The Luftwaffe has long been unwanted visitors to the skies of Russia. Now, we have a chance to pay them a visit in return."
 CHU_excellent_spotters:0 "Отличные корректировщики"
 CHU_excellent_spotters_desc:0 "One side effect of the complete dissolution of civilization in Russia is that many people cross borders on a daily basis. Whether smugglers, traders, or hunters, these intrepid travelers frequently go between the Reichskommissariat and the myriad warlord territories to make a living or a buck, following whatever opportunities benefit them the most. Russia's new nomads are mostly apathetic about politics and have usually been ignored by governments, but the amount of expertise they have on travel routes and border protections cannot be denied.\n\nAs we work towards accomplishing our goal of hijacking German fighter jets, we need all the intelligence we can get. Recruiting a few of these people as spotters and trackers would be invaluable in ensuring that our mission goes as smoothly as possible."
 CHU_special_units:0 "Специальные отряды"
 CHU_special_units_desc:0 "Stealing German fighter jets right off their airfields is a dangerous and complicated endeavor, and we need to make sure everything goes perfectly if we want to carry it out successfully. The hardest part isn't attacking the airport; it's delaying the inevitable military response. The Reichskommissariat is sure to respond as soon as it notices a base gone dark with as much force as it can muster, which is a staggering amount of it.\n\nOur only real solution is an incredibly daring one: deploy mothballed transport planes to drop seasoned troops behind enemy lines, where they can use explosives to destroy the roads and bridges connecting the airbase to the outside world. Extraction would be performed using the same planes, from the same runways as the stolen fighters. It's a gamble, but it's the best chance we have to beat back the Reich as long as we can."
 CHU_operation_red_eagle:0 "Операция «Красный Орёл»"
 CHU_operation_red_eagle_desc:0 "In the effort to create an army of combined arms that is able to effectively fight the German menace, armored vehicles are not enough. Another critical component is planes, which are significantly more difficult to come by, but a daring plan has been formulated by Nikolai Averin to get them. One night, an elite special unit under our command will be tasked with the mission to sneak past the German garrison lines, and into Reichskommissariat Moskowien, their destination being the closest air base.\n\nOnce they have arrived there and neutralized any threat the barebones guard presents, they will attempt to capture several jet fighters and transport them back to Gorky using one of the few old transport aircraft we have to offer. If the mission fails, our men will have proudly died in a necessary sacrifice. But if it succeeds, we will have scored one of the greatest successes in the decade-long struggle against the invaders."
 CHU_beginning_the_production:0 "Начать производство"
 CHU_beginning_the_production_desc:0 "Things could not have been going better for what some used to consider an unimportant bandit state right next to the German frontier. Gorky possesses some of the best industrial complexes in the region, that despite the trouble from the constant bombing runs can still operate, giving us an edge over our neighbors. Not only that, our missions into German-occupied territory have been a staggering success, giving us control of the most modern tanks and planes that we could ever dream of!\n\nFinally, as the cherry on top, the sole superpower that stands in our way to greatness in on the verge of tearing itself apart, as the structure the Nazi leaders have worked to establish for so long is coming back to haunt them in what could evolve into a bloody civil war. Everything occurring is favorable to us, and so our production must reach unforeseen levels, to produce a massive fleet of tanks and planes that will guide us to glory."

 CHU.1.desc:0 "Многие думали, что Аверин окончательно спятил, когда он впервые приказал собрать и подготовить каждую банку краски в Горьком. Его следующий приказ своим солдатам поменять оружие на кисти не сильно поубавил эти опасения. Однако, когда на следующий день он объявил о своих намерениях, реакция нижних чинов была исключительно положительной. Сама мысль о том, что ночью их обойдут стороной хотя бы несколько бомб, была достаточной мотивацией для солдат, и когда они в то же самое утро двинулись в сельскую местность, это были стройные колонны, подобающие настоящей армии.\n\nНесмотря на общую целеустремлённость, работа, после прибытия к месту назначения, шла медленно. Краски было много, но кистей не хватало. Только после того, как слухи о том, что происходит, распространились по близлежащим деревням, солдаты обнаружили, что их ряды пополнились десятками гражданских добровольцев, поскольку не только город страдал от непрекращающихся бомбардировок Люфтваффе. К полудню были закончены основные очертания десятков фальшивых деревень; к полудню были добавлены детали и зажжены небольшие костры. Удовлетворенные, солдаты и жители деревни разошлись по домам, надеясь, что эта ночь будет гораздо спокойнее.\n\nСмеркалось, одна из оставшихся позади наблюдательных групп услышала отдаленное гудение двигателей - первый из вечерних налетов. Медленно, в отдалении, эскадрилья темных фигур попала в поле зрения, прежде чем повернуть обратно. Через полминуты их смертоносный груз рухнул, и люди в соседнем лесу увидели, как десятки тысяч рейхсмарок тратятся на краску стоимостью в несколько сотен рублей."

Они заблудились в суматохе отступления после боя, а трансмиссия танка вышла из строя. Никто не знал, когда может появиться немецкий патруль, и поэтому поисковый отряд был послан за ними. Когда они пробирались мимо обгоревшего БТР, послышался слабый стон. Солдаты подняли оружие и осторожно приблизились. Внутри они обнаружили немецкого солдата в форме Унтер-офицера, держащегося за живот, слишком ослабевшего, чтобы держать оружие, и в критическом состоянии.\n"Перевяжите и возьмём его с нами, " - приказал сержант во главе отделения одному из своих подчиненных. - "Возможно, он что-то знает." Четверть часа спустя, таща раненного пленника, солдаты узнали корпус танка с опознавательным номером, который им приказали найти. Одинокий корпус, башни нигде не было видно, а на боку виднелся отчётливый след от попадания кумулятивного снаряда. Вздохнув, сержант быстро дал знак своим солдатам развернуться, и они медленно начали возвращаться к дружественным позициям."

 CHU.5.desc:0 "After them, goddamnit!"\n\n"Sir, with all due respect, this is a tank, not a fighter jet. It can't go much faster."\n\n"Friedrich, you imbecile, don't you get it? We're heroes once we get these bastards." They sped north through the Russian countryside, pursuing a motley collection of trucks and old tanks from the West Russian War as it retreated to Niedernovgau. Wolfram Tauber, the tank commander, became more excited with every kilometer they went. Since the war, many Germans had been swayed by that seductive call eastward, but few sooner than his family, which had moved to Moskau almost as soon as the area was opened to settlers. Tauber was raised an Ost-German, and he had dreamt his whole life to distinguish himself defending the Reich's frontier settlements from the subhuman hordes lurking just across the porous eastern border.\n\nWhen the garrison thoroughly routed the bandits at Saransk, he took his chance, ordering his men to chase after them despite not receiving authorization. To Tauber, that was unimportant; after all, his superiors would surely be pleased when he came back having crippled the retreating force in the name of Germany.\n\nSuddenly, the tank came to a screeching halt, and his racing thoughts with it. "Shit!" The shout came from Friedrich, the driver. "We must be caught in mud!" Looking outside of the tank, Tauber could see one of the members of the bandit convoy detach from the rest and turn in his direction. He gulped. Maybe it would have been a better idea to follow orders after all."

 CHU.6.desc:0 "It appears as though we may have slightly underestimated the tank hordes of Gorky. Our men fought valiantly, but in the end they were forced back across the border by the sheer numbers our foe possessed. Now they plunder the tanks we have left behind and hunt down any stragglers, treating those they capture alive with the utmost barbarity.\n\nThat we could lose to mere bandits in the first place is bad enough, but that this was meant to be a punitive expedition against Averin makes our loss all the more bitter. No doubt he will soon resume his raids with renewed confidence, and with many of our troops still in the process of reorganizing there will be little we can do to stop him. Morale among the common soldiery, already on the decline for several years by this point, has plummeted, and given the current political situation in the Fatherland it seems unlikely we will be receiving new equipment to replace that which we have lost.\n\nThe Battle of Saransk has been an unmitigated disaster for the Reichskommissariat, and we must make sure it is never repeated. Many of the officers in charge of planning the offensive have been dismissed for their gross negligence and our estimates of enemy force strength have been adjusted accordingly. In time we may be able to muster another force to teach Gorky a lesson and avenge our fallen, but for now the garrison of Moskowien must focus on its defense."

 CHU.7.desc:0 "The bandits of Gorky have presumptuously attempted to best the Wehrmacht in open combat and earned their just deserts. Across the fields of Saransk, Gorky's cobbled-together tanks sit burning, a testament to the quality of our dauntless soldiers and their skilled commanders. Such was the totality of our victory that a single tank was able to chase an entire platoon of Russians off the field, the only thing stopping it from further success being an unfortunate stretch of mud. Its crew have assured us that the vehicle was scuttled successfully after they evacuated it, and every one of them has been recommended for the Iron Cross.\n\nPossibly the only downside of this result is that we missed the opportunity to capture or kill Averin himself, the coward having chosen to flee as soon as the battle turned against him. Nonetheless, the importance of this victory cannot be overstated. Gorky will no longer pose a significant threat to our territory, and we predict that it will take at least a year for them to lick their wounds, at which point we will be even more prepared for them than we were today. Most significant of all, however, is the much-needed morale boost this triumph has given our forces. Stories of the 'Heroes of Saransk' are already spreading through the garrison's ranks, restoring the faltering confidence many have had in our ability to effectively deal with the bandit threat."

 CHU.8.desc:0 "It was scarcely past sunset, and the forward air base's guards were already asleep on the job. This was hardly unusual. Despite its closeness to Reichskommissariat Moskowien's tumultuous eastern border, it was quiet and productive, with bombers routinely going in and out to continue their job of dismantling any trace of civilization not under German control. The only real exception to this culture of effectiveness were the guards, a skeleton crew of SS conscripts chosen more for their small dent on the budget than competence or fighting ability. They were poorly trained, frequently drunk, and often absent. In retrospect, this may have been a mistake.\n\nThe bandit incursion was a rude awakening. Streams of the best soldiers Gorky had to offer poured in from all sides, massacring the still-sleeping SS and quickly securing the major administrative buildings before advancing on the hangar. Runway teams were brought out at gunpoint, and the bandits' real goal became clear to everyone; this was a fighter jet heist, the first successful one in human history. Several minutes later, another bandit detachment pulled up to the base, with a transport plane touching down to ferry them back to their territory, and it and the jets left together, almost as quickly as they came in. Nearly an hour after the last bandits had taken off, the German relief force finally arrived, the officer in charge fuming over the destruction of every road and bridge leading to the base by unknown forces. It was clear to everyone that this had been a meticulously planned operation, far beyond the bandits' assumed capabilities.\n\nBack at their compound in Gorky, General Averin and his men celebrated over copious amounts of vodka. Operation Red Eagle had been a success! They were now the proud owners of a large stockpile of German fighter jets, and production of replicas could soon begin in earnest."

 CHU.9.desc:0 "In retrospect, thought the leader of Gorky's special operations team as he bled out on the floor, the mission had been doomed from the beginning.\n\nIt had started out so well. Intelligence readings suggested that the base was an ideal target, isolated and poorly defended despite its proximity to the border. The other group, assigned to delay the military response by destroying vital infrastructure, parachuted in without incident. The primary team's infiltration into Reichskommissariat Moskowien had gone flawlessly, as intelligence gathered from hunters in the area allowed them to evade German border patrols. Shortly after sunset, they surrounded the air base, gunning down an unprepared skeleton crew of Waffen-SS guards from all directions. An hour after they arrived, they had already gained full control of the installation, and they got to work commandeering the jets and moving them onto the runway. The team was discussing party plans for their return when the tanks fired on the air base.\n\nFrantic radio chatter from the secondary team came in a few minutes later to explain the situation. By sheer coincidence, they had run into a group of soldiers not long after landing. The resulting shootout decimated the group and let the German response arrive uninterrupted. Soldiers stormed the runway, overwhelming the team in a hail of gunfire and ending Gorky's dreams of purloining itself an air force.\n\nAfter hours of waiting for the planes' return, General Averin was forced to acknowledge that the mission had failed. Operation Red Eagle was daring, but he had placed a great deal of hope in its success. This failure would be a serious setback for Gorky's rearmament program."
