 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_IVAN_ZAVOLOKO_DESC:0 "The people of Ivan Nikiforovich Zavoloko have long been derided as provincial rubes obsessed with a long discarded past. Schismatics, was the common insult for members of the old faith. This offended the Old Believers, for after it all they had merely saw fit to continue their forefather's religion without meaning harm to anyone. In Riga, Zavoloko sought to guide his community and continue his own research in the past, as a collector of old Russian antiquities. When the Empire fell, the old faithfuls thought perhaps a new golden age of worship could begin. Instead, the Soviet Union and then Nazi Germany brought oppression and savagery to the Old Believer communities. Following the Nazi invasion, Zavoloko followed many of his kindred on a long exile overland, fleeing the ruins of a destroyed future.\n\nIn Oyrotia, Zavoloko's first meeting with the native people not get off to a good start. The Altaic residents of the area had long disdained outsiders, especially once the rising Burkhanist religion became seen as a threat to the Tsar and then the Soviets. The adherents of this new religion found little pity for the exiles of a very old one. In a land ravaged by war and banditry, sharing limited living space with outsiders was seen by many as a suicidal move.\n\nFrom such an inauspicious beginning, to a leading role as president of this young nation with a dual religious and ethnic heritage, Zavoloko's rise has surprised many warlords in the region. His patient attention to detail, and his great empathy with citizens small and great has made him the one leader both population groups in Oyrotia will follow. However, a single man cannot be the foundation for an entire state. President Zavoloko and his supporters must succeed in tying the fate of both Old Believers and Burkhanists together on a deeper level, lest the young nation's future will die with its future still unrealized."

 ### Ideas ###
 ALT_religious_divide:0 "Религиозный раскол"
 ALT_religious_divide_desc:0 "The state of Oyrotia was built from the ground up on the principle of unity and solidarity between the two greatest movements that formed most of its population. These are the Old Believers, an Orthodox denomination long separated from the Russian Church, and the Burkhanists, followers of a syncretic native religious movement that sprung up in the early 20th century.\n\nThe two religions have maintained a relatively peaceful co-existence so far, but Oyrotia is no doubt shaped by a clear divide between its citizens. Each side has different goals and ideas for the nation, and the result of this is clear in a government that often has to deal with disagreements and discord between its members."

 ALT_christian_socialism:0 "Христианский социализм"
 ALT_christian_socialism_desc:0 "Many inhabitants of the Altai, native or not, held sympathies for the Soviet system for as long as it lasted. While the positive attitude towards socialism did not survive the passage of time, the economic policies of Oyrotia have no doubt been affected by it. Many Old Believers have drawn some far-fetched comparisons between the teachings of Christ and left-wing ideology, and have formed a set of policies they have implemented, different from almost everywhere else in Russia.\n\nIncluding partial nationalization and flirting with elements of a planned economy, they have been surprisingly popular, even increasing efficiency."

 ALT_agrarian_economy:0 "Аграрная экономика"
 ALT_agrarian_economy_desc:0 "As opposed to many other areas in Russia, the Altai has remained a region economically dependent not on newly built industry, but on agriculture. The sweeping wave of industrialization went barely noticed in the Oirat lands, and the efforts of the central government in Moscow to achieve it here abruptly ended with the Great Patriotic War and the fall of Bukharin's government.\n\nInstead, the economy is still based on agricultural production which the region is ripe for. The new local government has swiftly embraced that, avoiding any fast-paced and overambitious plans for industrialization. We remain, for the most part, an agrarian nation."
