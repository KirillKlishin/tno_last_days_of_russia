 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_LAZAR_KAGANOVICH_DESC:0 "Многие думали, что, когда бухаринский Советский Союз рухнет, одному из его заклятых врагов будет почти невозможно получить столько власти, чтобы стать одним из самых могущественных лидеров в России. Впрочем, Лазарь Моисеевич Каганович докажет им обратное. Будучи ярым сторонником Иосифа Сталина, он выступал против политики проводимой Бухариным, в следствии чего был отправлен в Западную Сибирь, что обычно не давало значительных перспектив. Однако, оказавшись далеко от линии фронта войны, он смог накопит силу, достаточную, чтобы сформировать одну из крупнейших группировок в России перед Западнорусской войной.\n\nПри поддержке маршала Константина Рокоссовского и генерал-лейтенанта Дмитрия Карбышева, а также поддержке 3-й и 10-й армий Лазарь Каганович мог провозгласить образование Западно-Сибирской Народной Республики, которая протянулась бы от Урала до города Омска. К несчастью для него, этой республике не суждено было долго просуществовать. Сочетание интенсивных бомбардировок Люфтваффе и двух его бывших союзников, дистанцировавшихся от него, в конечном счете привело бы к его краху. Вместо недолговечной нации, рожденной из пепла СССР, на Западе собиралась армия Рокоссовского, на востоке - "Черная Лига" Карбышева, и Кагановичу ничего не оставалось, как отступить в Тюмень и установить свой контроль над остатками Западной Сибири.\n\nТеперь Кагановичу приходится руководить развалившимся государством, пережитком времен России в межвоенное  время, в эти неспокойные времена. Он может быть окружен врагами как вне, так и внутри своих владений, но его революционная воля остается нерушимой. Будучи жестким старым большевиком, Каганович готов использовать любые средства, чтобы избавиться от врагов народа и воплотить всеобъемлющее пролетарское государство, каким его представляли себе великий учитель Ленин и его величайший ученик товарищ Сталин еще со славных дней Красного Октября."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHCHERBINA_DESC:0 "Неудивительно, что Борис Евдокимович Щербина был избран администратором Тюмени, если посмотреть на его послужной список. Приехав в Западную Сибирь молодым, но амбициозным партийным чиновником, он вскоре оказался в затруднительном положении, так как правительство в Москве пало. Он был огражден от хаоса Лазарем Кагановичем, который видел его мастерство и ко времени Златоустовского нашествия уже давно сделал его своим главным экономическим советником.\n\nТем не менее, его нелояльность к авторитарной системе, которой так восхищался Каганович, стала очевидной, как только хорошо вооруженные силы Драгунова двинулись на восток. Отказавшись от прежних убеждений и жажды власти, Щербина пришел к тайному соглашению с торговцами смертью. Уральская республика могла бы использовать его в управлении беззаконными землями, и за это он был бы назначен тюменским губернатором. Его талант скоро стал ясен как день, и теперь Щербина хочет сделать свою территорию образцовой провинцией даже под бдительным оком Златоуста."

 ISH_revisionist_remnant_desc:0 "Мы можем быть низведены до положения мелкого недогосударства в Западной Сибири, но мы не допустим, чтобы это был последний вздох дела Ленина.

Но не в этот раз. Черпая вдохновение у старого друга нашего Генерального секретаря - Иосифа Сталина, мы возьмем под контроль все на нашей территории; ничто не уйдет из под нашего взора, и все ресурсы будут направлены на будущее освобождение."

 ISH_holding_out_desc:0 "Территория бывшего Советского Союза никогда не видели более мрачных дней, чем те, которые они переживают в сейчас. Мелкие военачальники ведут войну между собой, и все это время ненавистные фашисты, из за которых началось все это бедствие, посылают свои ужасные Люфтваффе проливать смертельный ливень с неба прямо на наши головы.\n\nБолее того, жестокие фашисты Рейха просто не могут насытиться нашими прошлыми поражениями и предпочли бы идти еще дальше, пиная и так лежащий в руинах русский народ, пока он лежит. Это не может больше так продолжаться! Председатель Каганович слышит страдания народа, и готовит планы, чтобы облегчить самые тяжелый моменты."
 ISH_bunker_building_desc:0 "Каждый день, когда падают бомбы, людям нашей республики негде спрятаться, и они вынуждены спасаться бегством от страха, столь ощутимого, что он преследует их во сне. С каждым днем растет число жертв, и необходимо что-то предпринять, чтобы дать людям место для укрытия, когда Люфтваффе снова прибудет пожинать свою кровавую жатву.\n\nРешение? Больше бункеров! Каждый город, каждая деревня скоро будет иметь грозную систему бункеров, которые будут служить нерушимыми бомбоубежищами в мирное время и эффективной формой обороны во время войны. Наша республика станет великой крепостью, в которую невозможно будет проникнуть ни по воздуху, ни по суше!"
 ISH_military_holdouts_desc:0 "Теперь, когда для наших людей было создано множество бомбоубежищ, они могут сидеть в относительном комфорте и безопасности, пока Люфтваффе тщетно пытается сломить их тело и дух, но как быть с военными? Как дать им надежду, чтобы следить за нашими многочисленными врагами, когда на их головы регулярно сыплются взрывчатые вещества?\n\nЛегко: мы построим еще больше укреплений! На этот раз места расположения наших укрепленных позиций будут выбраны с учетом интересов военных. Наиболее вероятные линии обороны должны быть превращены в неприступные редуты, которые в большинстве своем безопасны от любого вида воздушного нападения, а также хорошо подготовлены к потенциальным наземным атакам."
 ISH_scavengers_paradise_desc:0 "Товарищи, давайте смотреть фактам в лицо: Западно-Сибирская народная республика переживает не лучшие времена. Большая часть его инфраструктуры в руинах, и бесчисленные десятки как гражданских, так и военных объектов были потеряны в хаосе. Теперь, когда мы пытаемся встать на ноги, нам отчаянно нужно вернуть это оборудование.\n\nХоть сейчас у нас не хватает производственных сил, чтобы производить товары самостоятельно, есть миллионы ценных артефактов из более лучших времен, которые просто лежат на открытом месте, ожидая, чтобы их взяли. Был дан зеленый свет для выполнения крупномасштабной экспедиции на ничейную землю с целью спасения как можно большего количества потерянных материальных средств. Если повезет, наши мусорщики вернутся домой с большим количеством брошенного оборудования, которое только и ждет, чтобы его снова использовали." 
 ISH_hidden_communes_desc:0 "Бомбоубежища зарекомендовали себя как эффективный способ защиты для нашего народа, но сама их природа означает, что те, кто все еще занимается своими делами на поверхности, должны будут испытывать острое чувство опасности о том, как успеть добраться до убежища. Что еще хуже, неизвестно, что произойдет, если люфтваффе решит атаковать нас ночью.\n\nПожалуй, было бы разумно расширить эти убежища, чтобы они служили другой цели: подземные защищенные жилища для людей! Если люди живут и работают в безопасности под землей, то им не придется беспокоиться о приходе бомбежек. А еще лучше, они наконец-то смогут спать по ночам, зная, что их не разбудит сирена!"
 ISH_behind_the_times_desc:0 "Современные технологии - это хорошо, но что толку, если наши заводы слишком повреждены, чтобы производить их? Дело в том, что вся роскошь современного мира должна будет подождать до тех пор, пока Народная Республика не будет забрасываться бомбами почти каждый день, и мы действительно сможем вернуть нашу промышленность к нормальной жизни.\n\nРешение проблемы заключается в обеспечении людей более старыми, даже устаревшими товарами. Хотя они менее удобны в использовании, их гораздо легче производить, особенно в такие напряженные времена, как наше. В конце концов, когда регулярно идет дождь смерти, наши люди вряд ли будут разборчивы в том, к каким товарам и услугам они имеют доступ. На самом деле, они должны радоваться, что им повезло, ведь они вообще хоть что-то получают!"
 ISH_survival_society_desc:0 "В наше время мы должны уделять меньше внимания комфорту и больше - выживанию. Решения нашего правительства могут стать решающим фактором между жизнью и смертью для сотен тысяч людей, и, к сожалению, наступает время, когда придется делать трудный выбор.\n\nЭто один из таких случаев. Бомбардировки поражают нашу благородную республику на всех уровнях, от невинных людей, которые беспомощны против мощи Люфтваффе, до наших военных, которые каждую неделю терпят непреодолимые потери от огромного количества воздушных ударов. Становится все более очевидным, что мы не можем спасти всех, и перед нами встает выбор. Должны ли мы сосредоточить наши усилия на защите невинных или на сохранении нашей военной мощи?"
 ISH_the_underground_world_desc:0 "Поверхность уже много лет является страной смерти и страданий, и наш народ считает, что гораздо безопаснее искать более перспективные возможности под землей. Кто мы такие, чтобы их останавливать? На самом деле, в этой тенденции есть большая мудрость, и нам следовало бы принять ее с распростертыми объятиями.\n\nСам председатель дал добро на начало строительства огромных подземных комплексов, которые будут выполнять самые разнообразные функции, от промышленности до жилищ. Были даже предложены идеи строительства целых военных баз под землей! Такова хитроумная изобретательность присуща истинно социалистическому обществу - находить надежду в самых неожиданных местах и в самые мрачные времена!"
 ISH_rapid_caravaneering_desc:0 "Еще одна необходимость, вызванная бомбардировками, - это система караванов, которые образовали линию жизни в опустошенных регионах России. К сожалению, фашисты уже захватили наиболее распространенные маршруты движения караванов и начали наносить удары с конкретной целью - перекрыть наши транзитные поставки.\n\nВ интересах предотвращения подобных бедствий в будущем мы начнем разрабатывать новые маршруты для наших караванов, чтобы подвергать их как можно меньшему риску быть перехваченными многочисленными опасностями русской ничейной земли. Хотя для наших караванщиков эти незнакомые новые маршруты потребуют некоторого привыкания, продолжающийся приток припасов, несомненно, будет стоить любых потенциальных неудобств, которые могут возникнуть."
 ISH_living_in_the_shadow_desc:0 "С течением времени бомбардировки только усиливаются, и наша и без того слабая промышленность растягивается до абсолютных пределов. В результате производство идет медленнее, чем нам бы хотелось, и медленные темпы порождают меньшее количество поставок и оборудования, поступающего на передовую линию. Для того чтобы наши военные были готовы противостоять любому противнику даже в этих условиях, возможно, придется пойти на еще большие жертвы.\n\nЗначительная часть наших производственных мощностей направлена на производство товаров для гражданского населения. Теоретически, перенаправление производства с гражданских товаров дало бы существенный толчок производству вооружения и техники для наших войск, но действительно ли стоит отнимать те немногие предметы роскоши, которые еще доступны нашему народу? Окончательное решение останется за председателем Кагановичем..."
 ISH_study_the_bombings_desc:0 "Люфтваффе затмевают небо своим зловещим присутствием, почти ежедневно обрушивая смерть на невинных людей нашей республики. Однако, возможно частота бомбежек все же может оказаться гибелью фашистов? Некоторые наши более проницательные товарищи из остатков наших Военно-воздушных сил заметили, что некоторые закономерности начинают проявляться в бомбардировках, но они не могут знать наверняка, пока приложат усилий для их детального изучения.\n\nС этой целью мы начнем записывать фашистские бомбардировки с этого момента. Расписание атак будет тщательно проанализировано, чтобы увидеть, действительно ли существуют очевидные закономерности в налетах. Если повезет, то наши товарищи смогут точно предсказать, где и когда упадут бомбы, и тогда можно будет всерьез начать настоящие усилия по смягчению большей части урона от них."
 ISH_on_the_clock_desc:0 "Наши усилия по изучению фашистских бомбардировок принесли свои плоды! Благодаря нашему интенсивному анализу их периодичности, времени и мест взрывов мы действительно выявилась весьма заметная закономерность. Могущество Люфтваффе в воздухе может быть действительно устрашающим, но теперь нам ясно, что эти фашисты - ничто, без своей внезапности.\n\nТеперь, когда мы можем точно и надежно предсказать, где будут происходить бомбардировки, следующим шагом будет подготовка потенциальных целей для этих налетов заранее. Хотя мы пока не можем остановить падение бомб, мы можем, по крайней мере, гарантировать, что они приземлятся в районах, где практически не может быть нанесен критический ущерб. В конце туннеля действительно есть свет!"
 ISH_the_mikhail_system_desc:0 "Товарищ Михаил, брат председателя, выступил с мудрым предложением о дальнейшем минимизации последствий взрывов. Он считает необходимым направить значительную часть наших усилий по смягчению ущерба на обеспечение безопасности всего персонала, который считается необходимым для нашего дела.\n\nДействительно, возможная потеря этих очень важных мужчин и женщин в мгновение ока из-за одного из налетов означала бы катастрофу для республики, и именно когда этот факт принимается во внимание, идея Михаила начинает иметь вес. В соответствии с предложенной им системой мы стреляем двух зайцев: существенно усилиям защиту, предоставляемую нашим основным сотрудникам, и в то же время не будем вынуждены бросать наших людей на произвол судьбы."
 ISH_off_the_clock_desc:0 "Системе по предотвращения любого значительного ущерба от взрывов, понадобилось время, чтобы показать свои результаты, но похоже, что она начала творить свою магию. Снаряды, обрушившиеся на нас из Люфтваффе, теперь попадают в незначительные места, в то время как наша более важная инфраструктура переживает налет за налетом.\n\nПомимо этого, число смертей, из-за бомбардировок, за последние несколько месяцев заметно сократилось. И снова наши люди чувствуют себя в безопасности, занимаясь своими делами на поверхности, пока соблюдаются надлежащие меры предосторожности, и по большей части нам больше не нужно бояться прихода Люфтваффе. Теперь, когда у нас есть место, чтобы дышать, возможно, пришло время начать выяснять, как подрезать крылья фашистам..."
 ISH_preventative_measures_desc:0 "Слишком долго мы находились во власти немцев и их Люфтваффе! Мы больше не вынуждены прятаться по бомбоубежищам, как крысы, в то время как фашисты терроризируют и уничтожают нашу землю, как им заблагорассудится, а наши ослабленные военные совершенно бессильны их остановить. Теперь их бомбы стали более, чем бесполезны, и мы получили возможность действовать и самим наводить ужас.\n\nС помощью передовых систем зенитного вооружения, которые мы добыли из различных источников за долгие годы, мы можем, наконец, использовать их, установив различные огневые точки вблизи мест, где часто летают немецкие бомбардировщики. Как только наше оружие будет на месте, дерзких пилотов-бомбардировщиков Люфтваффе ждет неприятный сюрприз, когда их, казалось бы, беспомощные цели начнут открывать ответный огонь!"
 ISH_necessary_losses_desc:0 "Несмотря на все наши усилия, по защите нашего народа от бомб, мы, к сожалению, по-прежнему не можем даже надеяться избавить всех до единого от их последствий. Председатель Каганович понимает этот жестокий факт лучше, чем кто-либо другой, и знает, что если он попытается поставить во главу угла как городское, так и сельское население, то не увидит заметного улучшения их нынешнего положения.\n\nПоэтому он решил уделить первоочередное внимание защите городского населения республики. Будучи более плотно населенными пунктами, города, очевидно, более уязвимы для бомб, чем разбросанные сельскохозяйственные угодья. В то время как города получат выгоду от новых бункеров, которые можно будет использовать в случае чрезвычайных ситуаций, тем, кто живет в сельских общинах, придется довольствоваться тем, что у них есть."
 ISH_do_and_die_convoys_desc:0 "В результате усиления сил ПВО в республике, к нашим границам хлынули беженцы как никогда раньше. Хотя мы приветствуем приток иноземцев на наши истощенные земли, их спешка в попытке получить безопасность, которую теперь обеспечивает наша республика, не осталась незамеченной нашим немецким врагом...\n\nМы можем попытаться помочь беженцам, но попытка спасти их всех приведет к катастрофе там, где ее можно было бы легко избежать. Потребности многих перевешивают потребности немногих, и, к сожалению, возможно, придется пожертвовать меньшими колоннами беженцев в пользу больших концентраций. В то время как многие невинные, несомненно, встретят жестокую смерть в результате этого, гораздо больше жизней будет спасено, чем если бы мы попытались растянуться, пытаясь защитить каждую отчаявшуюся душу, которая войдет в наши границы."
 ISH_black_zones_desc:0 "Наши производственные мощности все еще намного слабее, чем могло бы быть, и хотя бомбардировки гораздо менее разрушительны, чем были несколько месяцев назад, было бы все еще слишком рискованно пытаться восстановить разбомбленные заводы, которые были брошены давным-давно. Однако уменьшение числа бомбардировок открывает перед нами новые возможности.\n\nПредседатель Каганович санкционировал новый блестящий подход к возобновлению работы оружейной промышленности. Мы будем строить оружейные заводы и арсеналы в определенных, строго конфиденциальных местах, что поможет укрепить нашу больную промышленность. Эти места должны быть очень секретными и будут выбраны исходя из их вероятности быть обнаруженными Люфтваффе. С тех пор как немцы начали проявлять нежелание нагло летать над нашим небом, как они когда-то делали, существуют некоторые скромные районы под нашим контролем, которые не находились в сильном интересе со стороны налетов."
 ISH_unpopular_decisions_desc:0 "Несмотря на наши усилия по защите народа ЗСНР, бесконечные распри коммун и их представителей не только не прекращались, а даже усилились за последние несколько месяцев! Некоторые влиятельные чиновники утверждают, что мы принижаем роль коммун и народа республики в пользу более прагматичных векторов развития, чем причиняем страдания тысячам людей.\n\nХоть это и не совсем неправда, сейчас не то время для моральных делем. Даже если бы мы были настолько глупы, чтобы отказаться от очень важных аспектов инфраструктуры и промышленности нашей страны в пользу обеспечения того, чтобы несколько человек могли пахать свои поля, им, несомненно, удалось бы найти на что еще можно пожаловаться. Поэтому мы продолжим нашу политику прагматизма, которую мы уже успешно проводили, и обеспечим, чтобы эти бесполезные жалобы остались без внимания."
 ISH_for_our_survival_desc:0 "Ради нашего выживания, и ради спасения нашей республики, нам пришлось пойти на значительные жертвы во имя обеспечения безопасности революции и процветания. Было пролито много крови и отдано много жизней на этом трудном пути, который навечно останется в нашей памяти. Может наши тяжелые решения и не повод для гордости, но, в конце концов, они себя оправдали.\n\nБомбардировки больше не досаждают нам и мы наконец, спустя десятки лет, можем наслаждаться чистым небом. Люди выходят из своих убежищ и живут жизнью, которую они так долго не могли прожить.\n\nТеперь, когда мы в безопасности от немецкой угрозы, настало пора почтить памятью тех, кто пал в борьбе за эту возможность. Мы никогда не забудем их жертв."

Отдаленные удары и грохот больше не являются обычным явлением, сирены воздушной тревоги не кричали свои жуткие предупреждающие крики в течение нескольких недель, и ни один самолет не был замечен в небе в течение продолжительного времени. Террористический поход бомбардировщиков, который так долго терроризировала Россию, наконец-то закончился.\n\nТеперь, когда это закончилось, мы должны наверстать упущенное. Необходимо будет решить множество проблем, самая насущная из которых - восстановление страны. В конце концов, революция не может даже надеяться продолжаться, пока мы не встанем на ноги по-настоящему!"
 ISH_rebuilding_a_nation_desc:0 "Наш длительный период осады серьезно подорвал наши экономические и политические институты. Мы были поставлены на грань вымирания, но теперь, когда мы наконец-то спаслись от бомбежек, пришло время начать восстанавливать государство.\n\nПредседатель Каганович мудро составил план ремонта наших поврежденных заводов, вывода правительства из чрезвычайного положения и восстановления нашей бюрократии, обратившись к тюменцам с просьбой вернуть их в лоно после борьбы за выживание. Вскоре Коммунистическая партия прочно оттянет наше государство от края пропасти, и тяжелая работа по расширению сможет наконец начаться."
 ISH_rebuilding_the_factories_desc:0 "Начав процесс восстановления Тюмени, мы должны признать тот факт, что не все можно сделать сразу. Наши ограниченные ресурсы требуют тщательного определения приоритетов наиболее необходимых секторов общества, и в конечном счете нам придется пойти на жертвы.\n\nЧтобы быстро восстановить экономику в ее прежнем состоянии, мы должны установить прочную основу, и приоритетное восстановление нашей разрушенной промышленности - это лучший путь для этого. Время для сосредоточения внимания на гражданской инфраструктуре наступит после того, как мы создадим платформу для работы, и лучший способ сделать это - восстановить промышленный потенциал государства и медленно вернуть жизнеспособность нашей экономике."
 ISH_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Поскольку мы так долго оборонялись от немцев, у нас было очень мало возможностей сосредоточиться на военном развитии.

Пока мы находимся в меньшей опасности, чем когда продолжались бомбардировки, наращивание наших вооруженных сил жизненно важно.\n\nС возобновлением работы наших заводов, нет лучшего времени, чтобы полностью посвятить наши ресурсы военному развитию. Постоянный поток оружия и снарядов обеспечит рабочему государству его безопасность еще на какое-то время."
 ISH_armored_production_desc:0 "Военное производство продолжает расти по мере того, как все больше и больше наших заводов вновь открываются. Хотя это хорошая новость, мы не можем ограничиться тем, чтобы просто сравняться с нашими врагами в производстве. Мы должны превзойти их, создав новое и лучшее оружие, чтобы полностью сокрушить их на поле боя. Так распорядился председатель Каганович.\n\nТюмень примет только самое лучшее оружие войны, а что может быть прекраснее примера современной военной мощи, чем бронетехника? Дешевый, эффективный и хорошо защищенный новый бронетанковый кулак Тюмени станет тем авангардом, который нам нужен для распространения коммунистической идеи по всей России."
 ISH_civil_infrastructure_desc:0 "Наша долгая борьба с беспощадными бомбардировками Люфтваффе нанесла серьезный ущерб гражданскому обществу Тюмени. Нормальная жизнь была серьезно нарушена этими условиями; дома, школы и медицинские учреждения понесли серьезный ущерб. Нет более важного ресурса для нации, чем ее народ, и мало что можно сделать, когда общество находится в таком плачевном состоянии.\n\nХотя председатель Каганович предпочел бы сосредоточиться на военных начинаниях, он неохотно согласился обратить внимание Тюмени на восстановление сельского хозяйства и условий жизни гражданского населения. Как только ситуация вернется к статус-кво, может начаться настоящая реконструкция."
 ISH_swords_to_plowshares_desc:0 "Значительную часть военной техники Тюмени составляют запас времен Великой Отечественной войны. После многих лет бомбежек и беспорядков он, к сожалению, устарел и в большинстве лишь частично функционирует из-за отсутствия технического обслуживания. Необходимость замены всего этого вооружения значительно затрудняет наше военное развитие.\n\nПросто потому, что это снаряжение больше не пригодно для боя, это не значит, что оно полностью бесполезно. Проявив изобретательность, Коммунистическая партия решила перепрофилировать старую военную технику для сельского хозяйства, еще одной насущной потребности государства. Каждый грузовик, который служит этой цели, экономит правительству ресурсы, которые оно использовало бы для специализированных сельскохозяйственных инструментов. Это всего лишь еще одно напоминание о том, что наше руководство обладает творческим потенциалом и стремлением умело преодолевать любые трудности!"
 ISH_all_roads_lead_to_siberia_desc:0 "Ревизионистская буаринская администрация  проводила широкомасштабную индустриализацию сибирских территорий Советского Союза. К сожалению, до земель, контролируемых нами сейчас, это не дошло. Западная Сибирь сравнительно слабо развита, с инфраструктурой, не сравнимой с регионами дальше на востоке. Если ничего не изменится, мы обречены отстать, и рабочее государство останеться на краю истории.\n\nКоммунистическая партия не может знать поражений, и мы будем бороться за исправление ошибок Бухарина до последнего вздоха. Западная Сибирь сегодня, может быть, и захолустье, но если триумф Октябрьской революции чему-то нас и научил, так это тому, что судьбы людей могут измениться молниеносно за короткий промежуток времени. Под верным руководством авангарднах масс даже пустынная пустошь может стать центром мира и процветания, если бы у нее было достаточно времени. Возрождение Западной Сибири произойдет гораздо быстрее." 
 ISH_seamless_industrialization_desc:0 "Индустриализация - это первый и самый необходимый шаг к величию любой нации. Для того чтобы обеспечить нашу гегемонию над Россией, быстрое наращивание промышленного потенциала идеально, но у всего есть цена: перенаселенные города, нехватка продовольствия, ущерб окружающей среде и снижение уровня жизни исторически поражали мндустриализирующиеся экономики. \n\nЗСНР кардинально отличаеться от других экономик тем, что ее возглавляют наиболее сознательные, авангардные рабочие, который заботится о широком слое населения. Мы можем без эксплуатации капиталистов провести более справедливую индустриализацию, которая не принесет в жертву благосостояние людей на алтарь роста. Полный вперед! Под руководством председателя вероятность поражения несущественна."
 ISH_red_storm_desc:0 "После возвращения Западной Сибири ЗСНР смогла взять передышку. По сравнению с нашими войнами против предательской хунты Свердловска и фашистскими психами из Омска, этот период относительного мира кажется даже слишком хорошим, чтобы быть правдой. Но давайте не будем заблуждаться: это всего лишь короткая передышка от войн, которые мы вели в прошлом, и тех, с которыми мы столкнемся в будущем. Мы не вне шторма, а в его эпицентре.\n\nЧто бы мы ни делали, буря войны будет наступать, и мы должны быть готовы к худшему. В ближайшие дни наш промышленный сектор должен быть прочным и высокопроизводительным, нам предстоит еще много работы, но когда придет время войны, реакционеры, угрожающие России, узнают, что эта буря - это ярость рабочих, которая уничтожит их."
 ISH_the_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Настойчиво проводимая Николаем Бухариным новая экономическая политика была успешна в отдельных частях Союза, но она не смогла поднять большинство регионов страны, что привело к краху в противостоянии фашистам. Сейчас, нам как никогда нужно подьняться, и сделать это в крайне сжатые сроки. Следование старым советским руководящим принципам промышленного развития в нынешнее время, когда ЗСНР все еще ерайне уязвима, было бы самоубийством.\n\n Некогда отвергнутый пятилетний план, часть политического плана большевистской оппозиции, является единственным решением наших промышленных проблем. Огромная государственная мобилизация всех наших производительных сил на развитие, предложенная Иосифом Сталиным, спасла бы Советский Союз в 1941 году, теперь же, этот план вернеться и воплотиться на пути обьединения России."
 ISH_rebuilding_the_communes_desc:0 "Реструктуризация инфраструктуры ЗСНР для ведения войны потребует неустанных усилий всего населения. Быстрая индустриализация в стиле планов Иосифа Сталина, безусловно, улучшила бы ситуацию на этом фронте, но наш маленький кусочек СССР может быть не готов к таким радикальным изменениям. Реформа сельского хозяйства и поддержка гражданского населения необходимы для того, чтобы дальнейшее развитие не привело к негативным последствиям и обнищанию населения.\n\Новые, более крупные колхозы! Широкое распространение сельскохозяйственной техники! Массовое жилищное строительство! Коммунистическая партия будет отвечать всем требованиям народа и даже больше, и выгоды для промышленности в будущем будут действительно плодотворными."

В столь ужасных перспективах, было ло бы логично обвинять страдающих женщин страны в том, что они не хотят рожать детей в таком мире? Теперь, когда все стало лучше, мы столкнулись с другой проблемой: нам просто не хватает людей для наших будущих экономических целей.\n\nМы прежде всего партия труда, и нет более благородного труда, чем материнство. Субсидии семьям и матерям-одиночкам, награды тем "матерям-героиням", которые мужественно воспитывают 10 и более детей, и контроль над абортами вернут нас туда, где мы должны быть с точки зрения численности населения."
 ISH_family_building_desc:0 "Покинутый Бухариным в трудную минуту, русский народ, в некотором смысле, нация сирота. Однако есть также очень много настоящих сирот, тех, кто потерял своих родителей из-за разрушительных действий войны, голода или просто были брошены. К сожалению, детские дома Тюмени и многих других наших городов переполнены такими детьми. Теперь, когда у нас есть время и ресурсы, чтобы справиться с этой отвратительной ситуацией, мы должны это сделать, иначе мы будем не то что не коммунистами, а даже не людьми.\n\nЗСНР создаст систему усыновления, которая станет гордостью мира, объединяя семьи без детей и детей без семей. Скоро наши сиротские приюты опустеют, и мы сделаем первый шаг к преодолению травмы, нанесенной нашим самым уязвимым людям этой долгой войной."
 ISH_enforced_farming_desc:0 "Бурное промышленное развитие вызывает соответствующее увеличение численности населения, которое, в свою очередь, требует значительно большего количества продовольствия. Это понятно, но есть одна проблема: Западная Сибирь далека от того, чтобы быть житницей России. Сельскохозяйственное производство никогда не было специализацией этого региона, но трудно представить себе будущий путь для ЗСНР, если не уделить этому внимание.\n\nМы должны использовать каждый дюйм земли, которой владеем. Квоты на зерно будут повышены. Оставлять свои поля без дела будет запрещено. Крестьянство может протестовать, но в конце концов оно получит соответствующую компенсацию. Задача прокормить страну - одна из самых благородных."
 ISH_land_redistribution_desc:0 "Есть ряд крестьян, готовых внести свой вклад в наше зарождающееся сельскохозяйственное развитие, но они не могут работать без земли. Неравномерное распределение сельских земель препятствует достижению наших целей и ведет к большим страданиям безземельного крестьянства. Как и во многих социальных проблемах, ответственность за исправление ситуации лежит на Коммунистической партии.\n\nКоллективные хозяйства, политика Сталина и части большевистской оппозиции, подавленная правительством Бухарина, является ключом к преодолению наших бед. Государство будет управлять хозяйствами, на которых работают все крестьяне в районе, что позволит модернизировать и эффективно управлять ими в широких перспективах. Безземельные крестьяне познают справедливость, и в города потечет больше продовольствия, чем когда-либо прежде."
 ISH_communal_loyalty_desc:0 "Государство может направить творческие силы своих граждан на потрясающие подвиги. Однако оно не всесильно.  то время как внимание правительства сосредоточено на тяжелой промышленности и коллективном сельском хозяйстве, оно не сможет удовлетворить все потребности коммун. В такие времена люди должны взять дело в свои руки.\n\nПропаганда, поощряющая самодостаточность и сотрудничество между гражданами, является первым шагом к формированию духа революционного самопожертвования. Людей нужно учить тому, что каждый вносит свой вклад в коллективное благополучие, будь то строительство колодцев, обучение своих соотечественников грамоте, организация труда или любой другой ряд задач. Социалистическое государство не может работать, пока народ не научится работать сообща во всем."
 ISH_breakup_the_unit_desc:0 "Марксистская теория говорит нам, что нуклеарная семья исчезнет с упразднением частной собственности по мере того, как ее место займут общественные институты. Хотя в прошлом мы предпринимали усилия по реформированию семейных отношений, всегда есть место для дальнейшей революции. Следующей целью Коммунистической партии должна стать сама семейная ячейка.\n\nПередача ответственности за воспитание детей всей общине даст родителям свободу для работы или отдыха. Ценности коллективной солидарности легче привить, когда разрушаются семейные барьеры, разделяющие детей. Учитывая размеры и ресурсы нашей армии, возможно, было бы неплохо дать ей какую-то роль в этих новых яслях."
 ISH_rebuilding_an_army_desc:0 "К сожалению, военная история Западно-Сибирской Народной Республики не имела больших успехов. Республика, столкнувшись с предательством изнутри, развалилась еще до того, как смогла начать восстановление остальной России. Теперь, когда мы дошли до Тюмени и ее окрестностей, ясно, что нам придется пересмотреть нашу тактику.\n\nВооруженные силы являются, возможно, самым важным компонентом революции, и решение нашей военной проблемы также отражает то, что необходимо для обеспечения возрождения Советского государства: индустриализацию и централизацию. Красная Армия будет перестроена в силу, способную бросить вызов сильнейшим мира сего, и которая вскоре восстановит пролетарскую власть во всей стране."
 ISH_the_red_armor_desc:0 "Старый советский союз, ослабленный ревизионистской некомпетентностью, был совершенно не готов к нападению вооруженной по последнему слову армии фашистов. Некоторые из самых унизительных поражений были нанесены танковыми бригадами Рейха, которые захватили большую часть страны с разрушительной силой.\n\nГотовясь к возвращению Западно-Сибирской Народной Республики, мы можем извлечь один урок из опыта нашего врага: современная бронетехника - это чрезвычайно мощное оружие в умелых руках. Механизация Красной армии превратит ее в силу, способную быстро расширять нашу территорию. Решительные действия будут иметь решающее значение в этой войне, и сосредоточение внимания на танках позволяет нам сосредоточиться именно на этом."
 ISH_revisit_the_doctrines_desc:0 "Наши критики часто обвиняют нас в чрезмерной приверженности доктрине. В то время как приверженность теориям Маркса в высшей степени необходима, война - другое дело. Наша реконструкция армии для включения в нее бронетехники идет полным ходом, но наша тактика не соответствует меняющейся ситуации.\n\nТанк - мощный инструмент, но нам понадобится стратегия, чтобы не терять их понапрасну под огнем противника. Мы слишком хорошо видели во время Великой Отечественной войны, как немцы очень эффективно использовали быстрое развертывание танков, чтобы сокрушить и вывести нас из строя, прежде чем мы даже успели отреагировать. Возможно, нам нужен свой собственный "блицкриг"..."
 ISH_study_modern_designs_desc:0 "Длительная изоляция России отрезала ее от последних военных событий, что вполне понятно, учитывая общее состояние хаоса. У нас не было ни возможности, ни капитала, чтобы начать совершенствовать нашу танковую технику. Однако остальной мир добился значительных улучшений в этом отношении.\n\nК счастью для нас, нам не нужно начинать нашу исследовательскую программу полностью с нуля. Трофейные немецкие и тайно подаренные американские и японские танки стоят брошенными в наших арсеналах с 1950-х годов. Это только вопрос их обратного проектирования, прежде чем у нас будут собственные проекты, которые мы сможем продемонстрировать."
 ISH_homebrew_armored_power_desc:0 "Мы составили планы, заложили теоретические основы, внимательно изучили результаты передовой зарубежной инженерии. Мы наладили производственные мощности, необходимые для современной армии после многих лет непрерывного труда.

Наши заводы готовы произвести столько, сколько нам нужно, чтобы полностью освободить Западную Сибирь от предателей, которые так долго преследовали ее. Осталось только начать."
 ISH_our_own_designs_desc:0 "Хотя мы добились замечательного прогресса в наших программах развития брони, реальность такова, что Тюмень - все еще слаборазвитое государство, и наши конструкторы - всего лишь люди. С новыми конструкциями танков возник ряд неотложных проблем, которые необходимо решить, чтобы они были эффективными.\n\nЭта техника была сделана под большим влиянием иностранных моделей, которые не обязательно подходят для географических и промышленных условий России. Нам необходимо изменить их в соответствии с нашими потребностями и создать для этого систематический метод изучения и сбора данных."
 ISH_study_the_performance_desc:0 "К этому моменту мы добились больших успехов в проектировании танков и их теоретическом применении. Теперь, когда мы вступили в стадию строительства, нам необходимо перейти к практическим областям. Поэтому крайне важно точно оценивать их способности в этой области.\n\nЧто может быть лучше для исследования характеристик наших танков, чем проведение боевых испытаний? Наблюдение за тем, как они двигаются и сражаются в контролируемой среде, даст нашим инженерам крайне необходимые данные об их способностях и позволит нам вносить любые изменения, которые потребуются, основываясь на четких цифрах."
 ISH_our_own_stratagem_desc:0 "One of the greatest tragedies of the downfall of the Soviet Union was the scattering of some of Russia's greatest talents to the wind. General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, known as the "Red Napoleon" for his contributions in the 1920's and 30's, is but one of these. Before his presumed death during the collapse of the WRRF, he innovated greatly in the field of military doctrine, with his "deep battle" theory, which emphasizes the movement of many formations in order to achieve victory through the entire battlefield, being of particular note.\n\nIn a fight such as this, where resources are limited and the outcome of a battle rests on a knife's edge, superior tactics are vital. Repurposing the work of the Soviet greats will only help us achieve victory."
 ISH_study_the_results_desc:0 "Now that we have performed closed trials, the next step for our burgeoning tank program is live-fire incidents. In battle, events proceed that cannot be predicted simply by using observations produced in the safe environment of testing grounds, and tank crews act far differently when in real combat.\n\nFor better or worse, there are many opportunities to enter a fight in warlord Russia. Bandits and raiders have plagued the countryside for years, preying on the peasants and making administration difficult. Sending our tanks after them will provide a relatively low-risk way to gather results, as well as freeing the people from their longtime oppressors."
 ISH_the_red_army_desc:0 "The core of any army, rather than sophisticated weapons or lofty strategies, is its men. Since the Great Patriotic War, Russian forces have held their own against the far more modern Wehrmacht simply by being well-trained and disciplined, even with the gap in resources.\n\nArmor has its place, but focusing too heavily on new technology over the cohesion and effectiveness of our soldiers expends resources that we cannot afford to waste. An infantry-centered army, with professional, well-equipped soldiers and vehicles in a support role, is the way forward to a new Soviet Union."
 ISH_be_brave_desc:0 "The barebones conditions we have been forced to work with mean that soldiers are often insufficiently trained, with poor morale. Soldiers often fight solely for the potential paycheck, abandoning their posts at the first sign of danger. As we professionalize our army, reforming its culture is key.\n\nThe worthy successors of the Red Army need to match it in cohesion. We will create a sense of brotherhood and patriotism in our soldiers as a collective. Marx taught us that the anarchy of hyper-individualism is no way to run a society. It is likewise the path to disaster for any reasonable military."
 ISH_reform_the_NKVD_desc:0 "The Bukharin regime, compromised as it was by revisionism and opportunism, was unwilling and unable to properly crack down on counter-revolutionary sentiments among the populace. The military was particularly poorly monitored in this regard, and the ultimate consequences were the deposition of Bukharin himself and the complete dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe new Red Army will not repeat such mistakes. The recreated NKVD will focus especially on the military, ensuring political loyalty and education and prosecuting crimes committed by soldiers as they reclaim the country. We must never forget that the army has some of the greatest potential for counter-revolution and therefore take steps to keep it under as much Party control as possible."
 ISH_not_once_step_back_desc:0 "During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet Union collapsed the day that its soldiers first chose to run rather than defend to the last man! They spoke of the Motherland and its infinite land... enough population and bread as far as the Urals to feed them all, they said. How foolish such talk was! Retreat after retreat, the cowardly men of the Red Army failed to see what they were fighting for before they stood a thousand kilometers from Moscow. We now see all too well the finity of Russia from Tyumen.\n\nThis defeatist and cowardly attitude was without a doubt what doomed the Union! The men lacked resolve, the officers lacked tenacity, and the whole army lacked courage! Under the right leadership, we would've seen an iron Russia, with an industrial backbone and as foundation of loyal, unfaltering men.\n\nIt is with the goal of this in mind that we demand this of the Red Army: under no circumstances shall unauthorized retreats take place! Under Kaganovich, we will build a new Russia!"
 ISH_the_red_tide_desc:0 "The soldiers of the Red Army cannot simply be the most plentiful, as the Nazi dogs would like to portray the "asiatic hordes;" they must also be the strongest, the most zealous, and the best drilled in the whole of Eurasia! It is the Red Army's soldier whose duty it was and continues to be to defend his Motherland from the terrors of fascism and dangers of reactionary thought and division!\n\nIt is also the duty of every able-bodied Russian man to take the place of the Red Army soldier during wartime, as he must provide for the Motherland in exchange for what it has given him. In doing this, he too must become the hardest willed, the sturdiest under pressure, the embodiment of the Soviet Man.\n\nIf we are to bring back the glory of the Soviet Union and return the sanctity of the Motherland, we must start with our warriors. Under the new discipline we shall forge a new USSR!"
 ISH_be_strong_desc:0 "We, the Russian people, have been ridiculed and accused of being weak individuals, acting in hordes to move against our many enemies. We must show the world what the power of the Russian man is when utilized to his full capacity. With this we will unleash our new campaign, one of a simple motto, but one that will fill our soldiers with a patriotic urge unlike any other; Be Strong!\n\nFor too long the Slavic man has been trampled, his lands ravaged, and his people massacred. But that shall no longer be true. The soldiers of our armies will be the paragon of strength, the paragon of virtue, and as such must be equipped in turn.\n\nThe best equipment at the disposal of our armories, or that can be bought from around the fractured Russia we seek to piece back together, will be given to our soldiers. While the best Russian equipment is not the best in the world, our soldiers will, with no doubt be the definition of the New Soviet Man."
 ISH_reform_the_guard_desc:0 "The Guard forms one of the many political excesses of the system, a remnant of an older age that has rotted in incapability rather than adapted to the changing times. If they cannot evolve, we must force them to. The Red Guard, forming a system of paramilitary organizations more political than functional, is barely a combat-capable force, and in a situation where they were thrust into battle they would struggle at best.\n\nWe must change this through a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Red Guard. While the political aspect is important and their contribution to stability is notable we have been given reason to believe that many of the lower-level leaders of the Guard have no business being leaders at all, especially not of such an esteemed political organization.\n\nThe rotting externalities of the Guard will be cut off and ruthlessly examined, while capable men will be put into these positions. The Guard will also have more frequent training in more relevant tactics, with better equipment and routine pay to expand loyalty."
 ISH_russias_finest_desc:0 "Naturally, if our army is to be the one to bring back Russia from the brink, it must also be her finest. Every soldier must be the paragon of the Soviet Man, with extensive drilling in physical and mental exercises. The physical requirements will go up, and the room for error down. From now on, every soldier that serves for the future of the Union shall be the perfect soldier; strong, smart, and zealous.\n\nAround us sit peasant armies, mercenary armies, and the armies of false prophets. None of these would be a match for a truly battle-hardened, disciplined, and drilled army, functioning as cogs in a giant machine that will roll through all of Russia, from Vladivostok to the Baltics.\n\nIn the coming trials, each soldier will be faced with difficulty, forced to confront sacrifice, and even experience it themselves. It is our job to ensure that when this time comes, our soldiers will have no trouble dispersing the enemy, and bringing glory to our Union!"
 ISH_power_to_the_mighty_desc:0 "It has always been our goal to introduce to Russia a truly meritocratic society, where nothing but desert gives power. We figure the best place to introduce this ideal is to our army, where corrupt generals still sit in positions of power we value so highly. We must push forward a new model, based on the ideals of equality, fraternity, and only the best soldiers going up the ranks. We will never be in the position to be the true heirs to the Soviet Union unless this Union not only continues but expands on the legacy of the former one.\n\nEvery soldier will be evaluated, his determination measured, and his capabilities tracked. By tracking the abilities of our men, we can then make sure that only the creme of the crop are selected for additional officer training. The training and conditioning of our soldiers, matched with the leadership of a true meritocracy, will be the driving force that shall bring our men to Moscow!"

This dreadful state of affairs can be fully blamed on those who stabbed Chairman Kaganovich in the back when he needed them most, greedily splitting off to form their own personal fiefdoms. Previously, our forces were helpless to stop them due to the constant rain of explosives they were subjected to on a regular basis.\n\nNow, with the skies clear, we can finally begin plans to unleash the full might of the Red Army upon those who have foolishly betrayed the revolution and split from our glorious republic. One by one the rebellious statelets who insult the workers and people of the republic with their very existence will be brought back into the fold, and the nation will finally be whole again."
 ISH_pertinent_matters_desc:0 "Of those who split from the WSPR in its darkest moments, none are so foolish and so misguided as our immediate rivals based in the cities of Sverdlovsk and Omsk respectively. If we are to unite the republic once again, these treacherous rats must be dealt with one way or the other.\n\nOne of the most devastating betrayals was that of Marshal Rokossovsky and his Third Army. When the going got rough for our republic, the Marshal stupidly decided to abandon our righteous socialist cause by inciting the entire Third Army to desert and form a separate military government to the north. Although their forces have been weakened by desertion and infiltration, they are still a formidable force led by a highly capable commander.\n\nTo the south lies the Black League, who are based in their stronghold in Omsk. Although the traitor general Dmitry Karbyshev is dead, his successor Dmitry Yazov has reportedly galvanized the League and is actively preparing them for conflict against us. While his base of power may not be as secure as it seems, it may be best to snuff these monsters out before they become too powerful.\n\nOne of these traitors shall become our first target, and the final decision will have to be carefully considered."
 ISH_the_black_state_in_the_cradel_desc:0 "Dmitry Karbyshev, the hated general who betrayed our republic when it needed him most, may be dead, but his dark legacy lives on in the form of his successor: Dmitry Yazov. Yazov has already proven to be a potentially fearsome adversary indeed, and under his watch the Black League has become more powerful than ever before. If not dealt with soon, they could become a serious threat.\n\nThe Red Army's planned campaign against the Black League will indeed be bloody, for these zealots are famed for their inhuman discipline and ferocity in battle. Despite these advantages, however, they are lacking in mechanized units, and rumors persist that Yazov's regime is not nearly as stable as it would seem. Whatever strategic course of action we decide upon, it would be best to proceed with caution when dealing with these madmen."
 ISH_southern_buildup_desc:0 "The war against the fearsome Black League will be brutal, and the borders must be prepared for any possibility. In the unlikely scenario that our offensive becomes a disaster and our comrades are forced to retreat, they will need a line of defense to fall back to. Already the Red Army is deploying to the fringes of Black League territory, and once they are there, a fallback line will be hastily constructed while the plans of attack are still being devised.\n\nThere will be no second thoughts from this point onward. The scouts of the League will doubtless spot our troops' presence building up on the border, and these aggressive maneuvers will surely send our republic down a one-way road towards conflict."
 ISH_united_against_evil_desc:0 "The Black League, above all, seeks revenge against the Germans. While this quest is not entirely unwarranted, their methods of reaching this goal have simply gone too far. From top to bottom, the Black State is geared towards only one thing: war. As a result, the innocents who are unfortunate enough to find themselves living under the Black League suffer needless cruelties in the name of revenge\n\nOur war against the Black League will be more than just another step on the road towards rebuilding the republic, it will be a struggle against evil itself. When the oppressed peoples of Omsk know that our intention is to liberate them from their negative situation, they would surely welcome our forces with open arms and help our comrades to root out the League's dark presence for good."
 ISH_strangle_the_creature_desc:0 "The day has finally arrived, our plans to destroy the Black League of Omsk will be put into motion. The Red Army is to launch a daring and aggressive assault into the heart of their territory with the aim of overwhelming the forces of the League before they can muster a serious resistance. Most of our military experts agree, however, that the casualties sustained by both sides will be significant.\n\nThese Black League dogs do not deserve your fear, comrades! They may hold a great deal of bitter rage within their hearts, but they will soon learn that anger does not count for everything in war. The evil legions of the Black League shall be crushed into dust by our resurgent Red Army, and Yazov's reign of terror over Omsk shall finally come to a close at our hand. Onwards!"
 ISH_the_traitors_to_the_north_desc:0 "In the north, the traitorous Third Army have established a formidable presence centered on the strategically important city of Sverdlovsk. At their head is Marshal Rokossovsky, formerly one of the Soviet Union's finest generals, who has foolishly decided to throw away his legacy of serving the people in favor of establishing a military government of his own in the region.\n\nThe sooner we put this mad dog down, the sooner we can achieve our dreams of reuniting the West Siberian People's Republic. While the Third Army commands a highly defensible position across the Iset river, their combat effectiveness has been heavily marred by mass desertions. With their morale in such a dire state, they cannot hope to stand a chance against the might of our Red Army."
 ISH_rally_the_loyalists_desc:0 "Although the Third Army claims to carry on the legacy of the Red Army, they are, in practice, hardly a "red" army at all. Rokossovsky clearly cares little about furthering the socialist cause, and runs his state like a reactionary fiefdom where the military, rather than the workers, have the most say in the day-to-day affairs of the nation.\n\nThis clear betrayal of socialist ideals has caused a great deal of dissent within their ranks, and our republic has already received thousands of deserters wishing to rejoin our ranks to fight for the revolution once more. With the aid of a propaganda campaign aimed at encouraging further dissent amongst Sverdlovsk's socialists, we can widen the divides present in Rokossovsky's hypocritical administration and weaken his army's ability to resist our attack."

Surely you see the hypocrisy in Rokossovsky's past allegiance towards socialism being thrown away in favor of delusional Bonapartist ambitions? The West Siberian People's Republic and its chairman Lazar Kaganovich sees and hears your plight, and only holds your best interest at heart.\n\nWhen the Red Army crosses into the territories currently oppressed by Rokossovsky and his military goons, know that our first and foremost objective is the liberation of the people and workers of Sverdlovsk and beyond. Rest assured, the old Marshal will pay a heavy price for his crimes against the people, and order shall be restored in favor of a civilian administration. No longer will the "Red" Army of Rokossovsky claim to protect you on one hand and rob you blind on the other. Our republic will fight for your liberation!"

They are well trained, well equipped, and the terrain is heavily to their advantage. Despite these advantages, however, the complacent drones under Rokossovsky's command simply lack the socialist zeal of our own troops, who have once never wavered from their duties to the revolution.

Even in the chaos of warlord Russia, it is possible for a sufficiently amoral person to turn a profit. In Zlatoust, a clique of weapons manufacturers sell the weapons of war to all sides, sparing no concern for their clients' motives. The prosperity of all capitalists is sown on blood and exploitation, but Dragunov and his cronies have been especially direct in the bloodshed they have caused.\n\nThe workers' army stands ready to topple these vile criminals and seize their ill-gotten gains. Their massive stockpile of modern weaponry is only a bonus."

They have sold us the rope. Now let us hang them with it."

Our armies have been hardened fighting the likes of the Black League while theirs have grown fat and rich off plunder.\n\nThese bloodsucking capitalists have remained safe and sound while they plunge West Siberia into chaos and instability.

We cannot allow the bourgeoisie to stash their stolen wealth away from the hands of the workers who need them.\n\nCatching these scum will require casting a wide net. Motorized patrols will be sent throughout the region, searching every road and passage for black-market trade. Centralization is key to our victory, and all commerce must flow through the state."
 ISH_against_deranged_banditry_desc:0 "As greedy and vicious as the bourgeoisie are, they at least attempt to govern. There are few things more evil than the common criminal who cares about the people only as far as he can loot them of their belongings. Yugra, overrun by such elements, is a sickening sight to behold. Looters have long since filled the void left by retreating government, and the lives of the people are hell.\n\nThey are nothing more than self-interested scavengers, while the Red Army is an organized force motivated by ideological zeal. We will punish them mercilessly for their savagery."
 ISH_promises_of_freedom_desc:0 "The poor people of Yugra, crushed by the bandits' barbaric brutality, have forgotten how to dream of something better. They meekly cower in their homes, all thought of class consciousness or loyalty to the Union forgotten.\n\nOne of the advantages of preparing to attack an anarchic hive of criminality is that we can easily expand our influence over the border with Yugra. We will let the peasants know that they are not alone. The innocents will be freed from their oppressors, and the guilty will be hounded to the grave. Yugra does not know liberation, but we can remind it."
 ISH_man_the_front_desc:0 "Yugra is a massive territory with a border that is at first glance impossible to control. Fortunately, this means that the already disorganized bandits will have trouble guarding their whole frontier. Unfortunately, it means that our security is similarly difficult to ensure.\n\nThe Red Army is not known to back down from a challenge, but it will need some direction to adequately close this gap. Intelligent planning is needed to block the entirety of the border from a bandit assault with our available resources."
 ISH_into_the_north_desc:0 "All preparations are complete. The time is now to strike back at the bandits and restore our control of Yugra. This will be a challenging trek against a numerous and ruthless foe, but when have our enemies not been willing to engage in sickening atrocities? Ultimately, the bandits are cowards, unwilling to seriously risk their safety. They will fall in droves when faced with the Red Army.\n\nAs we set foot in this hostile northern territory, let us not forget why we are doing this: the Red Army is the last, best hope of working people against all forms of tyranny, and the slavering raiders of Yugra are among the worst tyrants of all."
 ISH_honor_the_heroes_desc:0 "Faced with the collapse of the Union, much of the Soviet military embarked on a cowardly path of desertion, mutiny, and criminality.

We will give them as many rations as we can spare, and Chairman Kaganovich will erect a monument in Tyumen in their honor. Anything less would be an insult to those who stalwartly battled the Wehrmacht when so many others abandoned the front."
 ISH_extend_our_hand_desc:0 "The Free Aviators, trapped in the frigid north, took on the Luftwaffe for years unaided. They made many sacrifices in order to defend the Russian people from the scourge of terror bombings. Now that the West Siberian People's Republic has advanced to their doorstep, they need be isolated no longer.\n\nThe Communist Party is hard at work drafting a suitable proposal for the annexation of the Aviators' territory into ours, permanently relieving their difficulties with resources and reuniting them with the Union's rightful successors. Every pilot will receive military honors, and the civilian population will be awarded for its dedication to the cause. Rest assured, their contributions to the Russian people will never be forgotten."
 ISH_a_red_air_force_desc:0 "Our successes have been highly encouraging, but there is still much work to be done, work that the Red Army cannot do alone. The Reich, naturally, has air capabilities, as do some of our warlord competitors.

Fascism has long since taken to the skies, and so must we, if we are to have any chance of surviving in the world of modern warfare."
 ISH_the_peoples_republic_restored_desc:0 "After years of effort from Tyumen's soldiers, workers, and leaders, our dream is on the verge of being reality. Barring Zlatoust, we control the entirety of the West Siberian People's Republic's former territory, establishing Chairman Kaganovich as one of Russia's most viable contenders for total reunification.\n\nAll that is left to do is reconquer our last few territories, and the Republic will be complete. Once we have consolidated control over them, we can move on to the next step: reestablishing a proletarian government across the entire former Soviet Union in the name of Chairman Kaganovich."
 ISH_honor_our_chairman_desc:0 "Not since Marx, Lenin, and Stalin has there been a greater friend of the workers than our own Chairman Kaganovich. He has toiled day and night to protect the people of Tyumen from fascist aggression and turn the West Siberian People's Republic into a worthy successor of the Soviet Union. His dedication, bravery, and wisdom deserve honors even greater than those we have already bestowed upon him.\n\nAnd honor him we shall. In the tradition of great Soviet leaders, Chairman Kaganovich will have a city bear his title; the town of Ishim will become Kaganovichgrad in his honor. May both of them stand tall forevermore."
 ISH_unify_the_industries_desc:0 "It is emblematic of our good fortune that our most pressing present economic difficulty is that we have too much industry to run effectively under our current administration. The West Siberian People's Republic has received a windfall of factories and equipment from recent military victories, and our management has not necessarily kept up.\n\nThis will be dealt with the same way the Party has dealt with similar issues in the past: centralization. A new, larger Gosplan is the key to pulling us out of this mess."
 ISH_siberian_rail_lines_desc:0 "The WSPR's relatively small size up until recently has made logistics relatively simple. Now that we control significantly more area, it is clear that we need a larger, more organized transportation network capable of transporting freight and personnel over greater distances.\n\nRail infrastructure is relatively straightforward to create and capable of moving enormous volumes of goods at fast speeds. Overhauling our network will make the WSPR more than capable of achieving its expansion across West Siberia and supplying its continually growing factories."
 ISH_aid_the_peasants_desc:0 "As the situation within our territory continues to stabilize, the Communist Party has been met with new responsibilities in the civilian sector. Now that wartime measures are becoming less severe, peasant associations have become bolder in their requests from the government, arguing for more tractors, tools, and state support.\n\nIn better times, we would ignore or suppress them, but our desperate need for provisions gives the peasants significant leverage. Special priority will be placed on agricultural equipment and government relief. They will get their demands, at least while they can pressure us into meeting them."
 ISH_encourage_workers_culture_desc:0 "During Tyumen's most dire days, civilian conditions were put on the backburner in favor of feverish military production. Those times have passed, and all statistics show that our workers are being rewarded for their efforts with deplorable standards of living, at least compared to those before the war.\n\nIn its magnanimity, the Communist Party has decided to devote some resources to improving our ordinary people's lot in life. The ordinary people of Tyumen will soon enjoy greater amenities, a more abundant housing supply, improved education, and all the food they could ask for."
 ISH_finish_the_job_desc:0 "After we have eliminated Zlatoust, there is only one adversary left in West Siberia, and it pales in comparison to those we have already faced. The inmates of the Vorkuta gulag were largely left to their own devices after the Soviet Union's collapse and took the opportunity to found their own statelet. They prefer to be left alone, but now that we have consolidated our power, there is no reason to delay their incorporation into our republic.\n\nLogistically speaking, this is a demanding task due to the necessity of crossing the Urals, but the inmates themselves are hardly a threat. They are merely criminals, and we are the people's judges punishing them for their transgressions."
 ISH_the_workers_paradise_desc:0 "Victory at last! Through the wise and cautious leadership of Chairman Kaganovich and firm adherence to Marxist principles, we have conquered the entirety of our former territory and are now stronger than ever. The West Siberian People's Republic is now the sole sovereign government in the region and a worthy contender for the reunification of the Soviet Union.\n\nAll this success deserves some celebration. Chairman Kaganovich has already declared a holiday, and military parades will soon fill the streets of Tyumen. Of course, the real thanks go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, for their tireless efforts and fierce loyalty to the Republic. Glory to the Communist Party! And may it be the Communist Party of the Soviet Union very soon."

Comrade Kaganovich understands that, if the state is to expand into the rest of Russia, it will need a strong industrial sector, a well-organized military, and a political system free of internal threats.\n\nThus, all three must be accomplished. Engineers and industrialists will begin the rapid construction of a new heavy industry sector that will provide tanks, rifles, and artillery pieces that will be needed for further expansion. The military will be expanded, and allowed to retrain and reorganize following the grueling campaigns to unite Western Siberia.

Doing so would not only honor the man's memory, but likely guide us into a brighter future."

 ISH_commissariat_of_civil_defence_desc:0 "An army by itself is not enough. While it is indeed helpful to have a million men on standby in the event of war, those men are of no use if given no weapons to fight, or if they are simply a massed horde. All armies require organization and logistics-- something in very short supply in the Siberian wastes. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich, in light of this issue and the ever-growing power of the state, has decided to organize a new governmental organization: the Commissariat of Civil Defense.\n\nThis new organization will oversee all the functions regarding the preparation of war. It will organize and equip units of men, ensure factory production is adequate to meet demand, and prepare propaganda for any eventual war that may or may not erupt. The world is a changing place, and the safety of the state and its people must be considered of the utmost priority."

 ISH_factory_institutes_desc:0 "The invasion of the Hitlerites and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union were great tragedies, not only for their cost in lives, but the damage done to the future of the Russian people. Many across the shattered remains of the Motherland cannot read or write, and know only how to till soil and plant crops. Such was the way for many centuries, but it is not the way of modernity. Today is the age of machines and factories and steel, and so Russia must be dragged, kicking and screaming, into being an industrial society. Many of the newly conscripted factory workers must be trained by another person, rather than being able to read and understand simple directions.\n\nTo solve these issues pressing down on the industrial sector, Comrade Kaganovich has devised a plan: factory schooling. In most major factories and industrial plants across the country, there will be classrooms in which the largely illiterate workforce may learn to read and write. While it certainly will not provide them with a true education as they would have received elsewhere in the world, it will be more than sufficient."

 ISH_breaking_some_eggs_desc:0 "As Comrade Kaganovich says, one must break some eggs to make an omelet, just as one must occasionally break down the political opposition to get something done. The internal political situation is simply too delicate at the moment for Comrade Kaganovich's liking. There are too many threats to his power, and too many traitors against the revolution. These men not only are a danger to the people and the state, they also could be implicated in certain... failings of the state in the past.\n\nThese agitators and problematic individuals must be dealt with, swiftly and with as little resistance as possible. They will be rounded up, just as their kin in the military were short months ago, and either carted off to labor camps in Siberia or executed. While some commissariats may lose some valuable assets, what has been lost pales in comparison to what might be gained from their removal."

 ISH_long_arm_of_the_nkvd_desc:0 "The NKVD is the most useful tool in state security that Comrade Kaganovich and the revolution could hope for. While it is certainly no small organization at the moment, it must be expanded the larger the state grows. The more citizens under our purview, the more surveillance and accountability must be placed on them. In short: the NKVD must be grown. It must have eyes and ears in every corner, every alley, every meeting room, and every production line. No one will be able to keep a secret with anyone but themselves, and thus, no conspiracies could be possible.\n\nThis new NKVD will strike fear into the hearts of men-- a fear that is quite literally unspeakable. All know that they are watching, but know not from where. All know that they are listening, and so dare not speak their name. They shall hold every transgression against the revolution accountable, and leave no stone unturned, and no man unquestioned."

 ISH_a_hammer_in_every_hand_desc:0 "Every man, young, old, sick, must serve society in some way. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production. If Russia is ever to be reunited under the banner of the restored Union, she will need every able-bodied worker and soldier that she can. While the new industrialization plans kick off, the newly-constructed factories will need workers-- a resource upon which all socialism is built. These workers will be, for lack of a better word, conscripted, mostly from small agricultural villages. Every hand not holding a rifle or a child will be given a hammer to further the goals of Soviet socialism. After all, idle hands are the Hitlerites' playthings."

 ISH_metro_2_desc:0 "Mankind is facing an existential threat unlike any it has encountered in its brief existence on this planet: total nuclear annihilation. Dread it, run from it, it may very well still arrive, and if it does, mankind is likely to face total extinction. Be it from the flames of Himmler's ambition, a rapidly escalating conflict between the world's great powers, or just a simple mistake, the chance of nuclear war is too high to ignore. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich has laid out a plan for the preservation of the Russian people and of Soviet socialism such that it may survive whatever cataclysm the man brings down upon himself.\n\nThis plan, dubbed Metro-2, consists of a large network of tunnels and housing built beneath Tyumen. It would function as basically an underground city, capable of housing around 10,000 individuals. The network would be built on top of the water table, and thus have access to clean fresh water, in addition to geothermal and hydroelectric generators, food stores, and even growing rooms for small-scale agriculture. It would also have a large research section, from which the state can perform its largest and most secret science experiments. If the world is truly set on fire, Metro-2 might just be the safest place to wait for the ashes to cool."

 ISH_project_cain_desc:0 "The "Closed Availability Information Network" is a project envisioned by Comrade Kaganovich and heavily inspired by the success of the Metro-2 project. In it, many major cities across Western Siberia would be provided with large underground bunker networks, ostensibly to provide shelter to loyal citizens in the event of a nuclear war. In reality, these bunkers would be largely composed of labs, filled to the brim with enterprising scientists. They would provide an ideal place to conduct our most secret and/or dangerous experiments, far away from the prying eyes of the people or foreign spies. While some may call the trials done here "unethical", there is little ethical about not exploiting any advantage available for the benefit of socialism and the Russian people."

 ISH_no_such_thing_as_propaganda_desc:0 "What liberal dissidents would call "propaganda" or "deception", Comrade Kaganovich calls "necessary". Siberia can be compared to a stained glass window. In the old days, before the Soviet Union dissolved, the Communist Party and the state served as the pewter metalwork that held the window together. Now, the window is broken into a thousand different pieces of a thousand colors and a thousand ideologies. The only way to put the pieces of the window back together is through the media and political indoctrination of the public.\n\nTo successfully achieve mass propaganda and indoctrination, a much tighter grip will have to be placed over Siberia as a whole. The mass media will have to be greatly expanded and new, standardized school curricula will have to be enforced. In addition, the NKVD will likely have to be deployed to many towns and villages across the region, if only to scare the locals into submission."

 ISH_only_truth_desc:0 "Comrade Kaganovich is a stern man, but a liar he is not. While he certainly has twisted the truth a little in the past, or presented alternative facts to a situation, he would never lie to the people of Russia! Some things simply don't need to be known by the public at large. State secrets or deceptive foreign lies that might paint Kaganovich in a bad light simply should not be shown or discussed to the people. While, behind closed doors, many whisper that they fear Kaganovich and his NKVD, most of those unexposed to foreign lies have a good opinion of our beloved leader."

 ISH_and_only_what_they_need_to_know_desc:0 "No one can be trusted. The most harmless in society can develop into vicious political manipulators, agitators, dissidents, and other enemies of the state. Every worker, every soldier, every mother, every NKVD agent; every single individual is a pair of eyes and ears that could be used against the state. If Comrade Kaganovich's vision for a restored Soviet Union are to be accomplished, the eyes of the people must be closed and their ears be covered to all information except what they need to know.\n\nThe bureaucracy shall be greatly expanded, to the point that access to information is virtually impossible. Army officers and party officials shall only be given the minimum amount of information to achieve their tasks. The only person who knows the true extent and goings-on of the new Soviet Union shall be Comrade Kaganovich and a very few select individuals. Information shall be the enemy of the people, and the ally of the state."

 ISH_a_job_left_unfinished_desc:0 "Despite all the work that Comrade Kaganovich has put into the internal security of the state, some individuals simply cannot be convinced to abandon their wretched ideologies. The people have already been exposed to dangerous, subversive beliefs, and must be silenced. They number in the thousands and make up a significant portion of the political bureaucracy, the military, and even the secret police. Now, all these disparate enemies of the revolution shall be purged-- something that should have been done a long time ago.\n\nNKVD agents who are known to be loyal will seek out and question individuals who have shown unpatriotic or subversive activities in the past. The men will be interrogated, put on show trial, and either executed or sent to toil away in a Siberian labor camp. For too long have they gone unchecked in Soviet society, but with Comrade Kaganovich as our leader, their allotted time has expired."

 ISH_new_talented_officers_desc:0 "The Great Purge, as it is now being called, is finally over. The last known enemies of the state have been carted off to Siberia, or put into the ground. However, the purge destroyed a significant portion of the officer corps. Thousands of military units, mostly at the platoon level, lack leadership. Without officers to lead them, our once-strong military will dissolve into madness and stupidity at the first sight of combat. To alleviate this issue, a new corps of officers will be trained from existing veterans. These men are experienced and battle-hardened, but simply lack the education in modern tactics and combined-arms operations that are necessary for the making of an effective officer. It will take some time, but these men can be trained and educated into extremely effective combat leaders."

 ISH_man_of_steel_desc:0 "Kaganovich has finally become the man he has always looked up to and emulated: Joseph Stalin, the man of steel. This is not only a want of Comrade Kaganovich; it is a need. Russia, and the restored Soviet Union, will need a stern, unfeeling leader if it is ever to reclaim her lost glory. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich shall preside over the revolution with a heart of steel. He shall not love his possessions, he shall not love his children, he shall not even love his people, but he shall love Russia."

 ISH_the_new_institutions_desc:0 "With his new position in the government secure, Chairman Khrushchev is ready to take the first steps to reform the West Russian People's Republic. New offices and administrations will spring up like flowers under his watchful care. Their administrators and directors will be hand picked to ensure his vision is realized. Though no large scale reforms will be enacted yet, these new institutions will lay the groundwork for lasting political change.\n\nWe shall not hold society back, for if the nation and the revolution to progress we must have our society progress as one, no more shall minorities fear, for we are all one."

 ISH_uphold_progressive_values_desc:0 "As stated by Marx and reiterated by innumerable socialist thinkers around the world, neither race, nor gender, nor national boundaries divide us. Rather, it is class that divides all humans. In accordance to this fact, we will promote cooperation between all peoples in order to bring about the end of capitalism.\n\nRacism, sexism, all forms of discrimination are reactionary -- we must eliminate them if we wish to bring about a communist society!"

 ISH_establish_the_assrs_desc:0 "The new Soviet Union we are building must not be mired down by ineffective, bloated bureaucracy. In order to govern the nation effectively, we will establish the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics along ethnic lines which will practice a form of self-government within the larger Soviet Union. The leaders of these new republics will, of course, be handpicked by Chairman Khrushchev.\n\nWe shall build the state as one to make even Stalin himself proud, for he is the one who guides us."

 ISH_a_state_to_make_stalin_proud_desc:0 "Comrade Stalin was an unappreciated visionary of his time. He would have wept if he knew that history had proved him right. Chairman Krushchev has taken Stalin's theory to heart and has applied them to great success. Even in death, his words still shine as the light that will lead the Russian people towards a more perfect socialism!"

 ISH_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "The world has changed. We must change with it. Comrade Kaganovich's policies, while indisputably effective, are no longer suited for this day and age. As such, Chairman Krushchev will begin a campaign to root out Kaganovich's influence from within the government. Officials will be purged, laws rewritten and repealed, and the damage from Kaganovich's premiership will be mended.\n\nWhile some may protest these measures, they are ultimately necessary if socialism is to survive in these trying times."

 ISH_the_secret_speech_desc:0 "There is no doubt that former Chairman Kaganovich's policies and beliefs were in betrayal of Stalinism, socialism, and the Soviet Union. Even so, dissidents and sympathizers still remain in the party. They say that we are the true revisionists, and that by purging Kaganovich, we have betrayed the cause.\n\nWe will prove them wrong.\n\nDuring the next party meeting, Chairman Krushchev will speak to a closed audience and reveal to all the true extent of Kaganovich's crimes against the people. There, we will also reveal our agenda to help mend the damage caused by him and his ilk.

 ISH_lock_down_the_party_desc:0 "The Communist Party, especially in its current state, simply cannot be trusted to properly safeguard socialism and the proletariat. Recognizing this fact, Chairman Krushchev will put a moratorium on elections to the Party. By doing so, he will be able to take total control of the government. This is necessary, as he is the only man capable of defending the people against the dangers of reactionarism. With the power that comes with total control, Krushchev will be able to better execute Stalin's vision for a great Russia."

 ISH_another_five_year_plan_desc:0 "The original five year plan has reached its completion. Given its resounding success, Chairman Khrushchev has seen fit to announce a new, second five year plan. The people of Russia will work and toil in a glorious effort to continue industrialization on a greater scale than ever before and bring the country one step closer to true industrial socialism.\n\nIts time that we reintigrate our Western lands, We are all Russians."

 ISH_reintegrate_the_west_desc:0 "The German fascists might have destroyed Russia, but they could never destroy the Soviet spirit. Together, we will rebuild the nation under the red banner of the Soviet Union. Nothing will stop the people in their drive to reunite the homeland!"

 ISH_continue_agricultural_mechanization_desc:0 "For thousands of years, agriculture has sustained humanity and strengthened all nations of the world. In order to ensure we reap all possible benefits from agriculture, we shall fully mechanize it and educate the farmers on how to keep the soil fertile. In time, the literal fruits of our labor will show, in the bounty of food that our people can then harvest and enjoy."

 ISH_repudiate_literary_policy_desc:0 "The old literary policy is contradictory to the ideals of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. The purpose of books is to uplift the proletariat, rather than keep them down. As such, Chairman Krushchev will lift Kaganovich's repression on books and other such artistic expressions. The proletarians of Russia shall become the most cultured in the world!"

 ISH_an_end_to_extraneous_repression_desc:0 "The Red Army is our sword and shield, and the defender of the proletariat. It would not only be unwise, but it would be an injustice to punish them for such bravery in battle. The Army and its personnel should serve the Union out of respect and love for the Chairman, not out of fear for him. To this end, we will put an end to any and all repression within the army." 

 ISH_commence_the_khrushchevshchina_desc:0 "Russia has progressed far beyond its image of poverty and backwardness. Factories hum with the sound of machinery, as men and women work together as one to better Russia. Tractors make their rounds around the fields of wheat, to be sent to the cities to make bread for the workers. Yet Russia's culture remains firmly entrenched in feudalist reactionarism. As such, a wave of cultural reforms will be enacted by Chairman Krushchev in order to rectify this issue. The vestiges of the old world must be eliminated for a truly socialist society to take hold."

 ISH_shining_in_glory_desc:0 "Russia has risen from the ashes, as a beacon of socialism amongst a world of exploitation and tyranny. Our resurgence will not end here, for we march to liberate the workers of the world. We have defeated the fascist Germans with even less than what we have now; with the resources of today, we are a world power. And unlike the others, we will use our status to advance the global proletarian cause."


 ### Events ###
 ISH.1.t:0 "The Ghost of Stalin"
 ISH.1.d:0 "Long live the Communist Party of Lenin-Stalin! Long live General Secretary of the West Siberian Communist Party Comrade Lazar Kaganovich! Long live the people of Russia, the cause of the people, and the Red Army who keeps us safe!\n\nDeath to the Black League in Omsk who have betrayed the revolution and will bring ruin to all of Russia! Death to the madman Karbyshev who leads them and wishes to plunge our once glorious nation into darkness! Death to the traitors of the Red Army in Sverdlovsk, who have threatened to destroy our glorious military and threaten to destroy our glorious nation! And death to the treacherous 'Field Marshal' Rokossovsky who leads this revolt against the glory of Comrade Kaganovich!\n\nWhen the traitor Bukharin assigned Comrade Kaganovich to Western Siberia, he did not realize that he would be setting the path for his own demise. When he showed his true colors and failed to stop the hated German scum from destroying our beautiful nation, Comrade Kaganovich led a glorious civil war against Bukharin in the name of his former comrade, Josef Stalin. While the Union fell, Kaganovich never ended his cause, and formed the great People's Republic of Western Siberia.\n\nTime did not prove our ally however, as the traitors in Omsk and Sverdlovsk betrayed the revolution and launched a surprise attack on the capital of Tyumen. While we bravely held out and stopped these attacks, the People's Republic now lies dead. With the German bombings still pummeling what little we have to dust, this situation has now lasted for over a year. Soon, however, we will find a way to bring justice to these traitors, and restore the Union for the glory of Comrade Kaganovich! And Comrade Stalin! And Comrade Lenin! For the people! Urah!"
 ISH.1.a:0 "Ura!"
 
 ISH.2.t:0 "A Tale of East vs West"
 ISH.2.d:0 "While Lazar Kaganovich has focused most of the reunited Soviet Union to the nation's first 'Five Year Plan', he has set aside several of the rising nation's intelligentsia for a different task.\n\nToday, 'A Tale of East vs West', has released internationally. Commissioned by Kaganovich, based off his personal writings, and sent abroad with hopes that its observation into an alternate history where Kaganovich's idol, Joseph Stalin, won his power struggles against Nikolai Bukharin would gain it legitimacy. The book was even touted pre-release as as the 'first piece of Russian literature in half a century' by the New York Times.\n\nSadly, however, for the Kaganovich regime, the book has been critically panned everywhere but the Soviet Union itself where reading of it has become mandatory in several state schools. Critics and historians both point out the unrealism of its plot and the ridiculous stretches of historical plausibility. The tale involves things such as Stalin not only managing to destroy Nazi Germany but reach as far as Berlin, forming a 'Budapest Pact' to counter a western led 'North Atlantic Treaty Coalition', an Israeli home state formed by the British (who manage to retain most of their Empire but slowly withdraw along with most other European powers due to rising tides of African nationalism) and a Soviet Union that lasts, 'until at least the 80s, during which Stalinism and the free market will begin their final confrontation, and if Stalinism loses, Russia will still follow its legacy and regain its strength in the new millennium with an invasion of Ukraine.'\n\nHow such rubbish even got published is anyone's guess."
 ISH.2.a:0 "But what happened to Trotsky!?"

 ISH.3.t:0 "The Burden We Bear"
 ISH.3.d:0 "Comrade! There is no denying that things are hard. The Soviet Union was great, but treason, fascism, and revisionism have whittled it down to a husk of its former self. Nevertheless, we are the true successors, untainted by Bukharinism or any other deviation from the path of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. The traitors can slander us, subvert us, bomb us, and murder us. They cannot murder the righteous spirit of the working class.\n\nComrade! Be reassured by the fact that the Communist Party has made many sacrifices in your name. Chairman Kaganovich works day and night striving to protect you from Naziism and warlordism. The Red Army, stalwart as ever, stands vigilant against the bandits who would harm you. The finest government in Russia makes the hardest decisions so that you can live without fear.\n\nComrade! If you feel discouraged, remember this: all of our hardships, all of our enemies have carved us into a point sharper than a bayonet. As we pierce through our adversaries, ask yourself a vital question. How can you serve?"
 ISH.3.a:0 "By devoting every fiber of my being to the Communist cause!"

 ISH.4.t:0 "Bunkers in the Distance"
 ISH.4.d:0 "A plume of smoke exited Private Stanislav Kharitonov's lungs as he gazed out from the top of the hill. It was the crack of dawn, earlier even than the hour he was roughly shaken out of bed most days. What could be done? He was on watch, and his duty was to watch. The Red Army tolerated few things less than insubordination. At least he could smoke.\n\nHe took an appreciative drag on his cigarette and let his eyes to pull him to something interesting. His vision settled on the bomb shelters placidly sitting in the distance, awaiting their purpose. It might have been the hour of day, but he was feeling contemplative. He had never quite appreciated how much of an achievement they were. After all they had faced, the collapse of the Union, the treason from within the general corps, the collapse, the West Siberian People's Republic endured, at least in Tyumen. No amount of bombs or bullets could keep the soldiers of the proletariat from taking back what was rightfully theirs.\n\nSure, the army was strict. To Stanislav and thousands like him, that was nothing compared to the losses they had already suffered."
 ISH.4.a:0 "The Red Army stands."

 ISH.5.t:0 "Sanctioned Salvaging Expeditions"
 ISH.5.d:0 "The collapsing Soviet Union left behind a huge number of settlements, supply caches, factories, and other structures that its successor statelets never had the budget or ability to reclaim. The WSPR's recent turmoil has delayed our ability to organize large-scale expeditions.\n\nEven with these circumstances, the workers win small victories! We have located several salvageable sites in the vicinity of Tyumen. The first is a large store of fuel left behind from an armor division that never deployed. The second is a stash of military equipment abandoned after mass desertions. Least important for the war effort but potentially valuable for morale is a warehouse of food, clothes, and other civilian amenities.\n\nAt the moment, we only have the resources for one. In our state of total mobilization, fuel or arms would be invaluable, but there is also a question of how much the people can bear."
 ISH.5.a:0 "We must not harden our hearts. Choose the amenities."
 ISH.5.b:0 "A bigger gun, a longer life. Choose the arms."
 ISH.5.c:0 "Our army needs to last. Choose the fuel."

 ISH.6.t:0 "Emergency Measures"
 ISH.6.d:0 "Every bomb that drops is another choice we must make. Who do we protect? Try as we might, there simply aren't enough bunkers in Tyumen to make sure everyone is safe. As with anything, there are trade-offs. Each soldier that survives is one that can contribute to the war effort. Many of our brass convincingly argue that we must prioritize the men who can drag us out of this miserable state.\n\nAnd yet, Chairman Kaganovich hesitates. What good are soldiers if they cower while the people they should be protecting are defenseless? The present crisis will pass, but the next generation will remember our sins. Civilian morale, already tenuous, may not survive the abandonment of women and children to the Luftwaffe's predations. Important voices of the administration believe that we must defend our most vulnerable so as not to lose sight of the morals that drive us.\n\nThe bombers will not wait for us to make decisions. Better to save one group now than to deliberate and lose both."
 ISH.6.a:0 "How can we speak for the workers if we don't defend them?"
 ISH.6.b:0 "We can mourn the civilians when we have taken Moscow."

 ISH.7.t:0 "Under the Earth"
 ISH.7.d:0 "Waiting in the hall outside of the local party secretary's office, Igor could feel his hands trembling. By God! If only the workers had delegated a different foreman to make the report. He rehearsed the statement in his head.\n\n"Comrade Secretary, some of the men have concerns about the safety of these bunker construction plans. They feel as though the plans, as written, would produce structures at an intolerable risk of collapse. Of course, this is not to say that you, Comrade Kaganovich, or the Communist Party have done even a single thing to jeopardize the safety of the people of Tyumen. If it could be that the plans have been sabotaged by counter-revolutionaries, or incompetence among the workers, I would completely accept responsibility."\n\nA few more minutes of waiting and rehearsing went by before the door finally opened, and the secretary, a short, bored-looking Armenian, emerged from his office. Despite his efforts, Igor's statement came out in a nervous torrent, but the secretary shushed him before he could even get to the mandatory praise of Kaganovich.\n\n"Yes, yes, safety concerns. I'll let my superiors know."\n\nAs the man closed the door, Igor felt relief wash over him in a wave. All that was left to do was hope that the message would climb the chain of phone calls to Kaganovich himself, and that the famously stubborn leader of Tyumen would heed it."
 ISH.7.a:0 "Who are we, if we cannot keep the people safe?"
 ISH.7.b:0 "We must prioritize efficiency over all - to house everyone."

 ISH.8.t:0 "Hidden Away"
 ISH.8.d:0 "Nursing a cup of coffee at his desk, Lazar Kaganovich yawned deeply. A brief glance at the clock told him that it was nearly midnight, meaning that he had been in his office reading reports and authorizing various state functions all day. Rebuilding a nation was hard work! And yet there was plenty left to do before he could retire for the night. Just then, an aide, evidently also quite tired, entered the room. Kaganovich's aides were expected to keep the same schedule he did, and few had "Iron Lazar's" endurance.\n\n"I have another report for you, sir, concerning the state of our industrial development."\n\nThe Chairman made a brief grunt of acknowledgement before dismissing him and shifted in his seat to read the document. It had something to do with increasing production, like so many of the other communiques he had read that day. His eyelids sunk before he caught himself in the act. He really was exhausted, he thought to himself. He continued reading. The document, in very dry, bureaucratic language, enumerated the possibility of reducing the production of consumer goods to hasten that of heavy machinery. It reflected briefly on the effects on civilians before dismissing the concern. They had already put up with so much for the sake of the nation, why not just a bit more?\n\nThe idea of retiring to his quarters now and leaving the matter until morning floated into his mind before he pushed it aside. The Soviet Union had no use for a leader who couldn't discipline himself. He pondered for a few more minutes before, as he had done many times before, taking out a pen and writing his decision on the document."
 ISH.8.a:0 "Do it. They will enjoy luxuries later."
 ISH.8.b:0 "The people deserve their small victories."

 ISH.9.t:0 "Our Program Yields Results"
 ISH.9.d:0 "As always with Chairman Kaganovich, his proposals to monitor the schedule of German terror-bombers has been an excellent success. The people, well alerted of potential attacks, have never been safer, and supply lines are moving better than ever. We cannot allow ourselves to be complacent; the Communist Party does not settle for adequacy, but strives to achieve perfection! We may have figured out their schedule for now, but the Germans can always change it once they realize our ingenuity. It is for this reason that a more permanent solution to the bombings needs to be put in place.\n\nOne potential option is to use our knowledge of their movements to go on the attack, delivering the people a badly needed blow against the fascists, so that they think twice before menacing them again. This solution would involve building fighter planes to intercept the bombers mid-air, using the element of surprise to overcome the technology gap. Fascists are inherently cowardly, and the Luftwaffe is not accustomed to resistance; a decisive strike could scare them away from our airspace in favor of weaker targets.\n\nThe next solution is more cautious, but with the potential of dealing with the problem for longer. Radar towers proved quite effective in prior wars, and their ability to remotely monitor aircraft would negate the need for detailed bombing schedules in the future, since we could react to bombers as we detect them. This type of response, while not directly challenging the bombers, could severely curtail their efforts in the future.\n\nThe Germans, brutish though they are, are not stupid. Whichever operation we choose will need to be flexible and highly responsive in order to ensure it is not bypassed completely by a change in the Luftwaffe's tactics."
 ISH.9.a:0 "Focus on detecting the enemies."
 ISH.9.b:0 "Focus on making interception viable."

 ISH.10.t:0 "Mikhail's Proposals"
 ISH.10.d:0 "It might be thought that a man like Lazar Kaganovich, who made exceptionally harsh demands of others, would do so out of personal laziness. The opposite was true. Kaganovich was a workhorse, and he could usually be found at his office desk, surrounded by a dense cloud of cigar smoke as he pored over documents, breaking up the monotony with the occasional shouted phone call. It was in this state that Mikhail, his brother and economic minister, found him as he prepared to deliver a stack of papers.\nMikhail stood in the doorway, coughing as the smoke invaded his lungs. Although Lazar was actually the younger sibling, he couldn't help but feel intimidated, but Mikhail buried his feelings. They were brothers, after all, and this was important. He waited for Lazar to acknowledge his presence, but the Chairman's work continued unabated, either because he didn't hear Mikhail or because he didn't care. Mikhail cleared his throat.\n"I have some proposals I'd like you to read when you have the time."\n"Hm? Oh, yes, of course," Lazar replied unconvincingly, his attention clearly drawn to the already impressive pile on his desk. Seeing that his brother was still standing there, he spoke again, clearly irritated. "Do you have any other concerns? I'd like to get back to work, if you don't mind."\nMikhail awkwardly took his leave. Although he would rather put faith in his brother, he knew instinctively that his stack of proposals would go unread for a good while longer."

 ISH.11.t:0 "The Patterns Shift"
 ISH.11.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was frustrated. The German bombing schedule, which had remained relatively consistent for years, had changed. It was not a large change - in truth things would not be too difficult to adjust and continue on the course they had been up to this point. However, on his desk sat a proposal, a proposal put forward by Mikhail to adjust the urban defenses in order to make up for the change.\n\nOn the one hand, simply continuing construction of bunkers would make any changes in the schedule moot. On the other, adapting to the new schedule for the defense of the above ground infrastructure would be better in the short term for the people and morale in general.\n\nNo matter what option was chosen, it would be a huge investment. The bunkers would provide a complete defense against the bombs, and if the bombing ever ended they would be useful for defending infrastructure against the other warlords of Russia. But at the same time, keeping the defenses flexible would allow for a quicker response to changes in the bombing.\n\nIndeed, both ideas had their promise but only one could be followed in the end, the question was, which one?"
 ISH.11.a:0 "Utilize Mikhail's program to adapt."

 ISH.12.t:0 "Feeding the Underground"
 ISH.12.d:0 "Deep under the streets of the People's Republic, teams of men swung their picks and shovels to clear tunnels for the newest metro tunnel in the Republic. Vladislav Shapovalov swung his pick and split a section of stone. His crew were to finish the last section of the tunnel so other crews could come in to lay the track. It was back breaking work, and it never seemed to be enough, but it was work and that is more than he had had in years.\n\nVlad found that, despite the danger, he found a degree of fulfillment in his work. The threat of tunnel collapse was a near constant in the new excavations, before the supports were put in. He had lost a lot of friends to collapses, most recently Lev, but even then the work was worth it. It was drilled into their heads often enough how important this line was, the safety of their families relied on the tunnels. This tunnel in particular was integral to ensuring that the factories were unaffected by the bombs, and safe factories meant better lives for their families.\n\nVlad could hear the machinery running on the other side of the rock now. He knew it would only be a matter of hours before the tunnel was ready for further construction. As he swung his pick, Vlad heard the characteristic rumbling that came before a cave-in. He shouted "Cave-in!" and directed his men to the safe section further back the way they had come. He was the last one back before the roof gave way and the passage was sealed by meters of rock."

 ISH.13.t:0 "A Final Triumph"
 ISH.13.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was ecstatic. The programs he had put his being into had been a smashing success. The perfidious Germans and their bombs had plagued the people of the People's Republic for so long that they had used the bombings as an alarm of sorts. It would take much getting used to, as the old status quo would be swept away in a new age of prosperity.\n\nHowever, with the success of the programs, the bombers that were once the dread of every citizen of Russia were now an afterthought. The people of Tyumen lived their lives in the most carefree way they had in years. For the first time, the threat of sudden death was practically gone from the lives of the Russian people.\n\nLazar led a small toast in his office, his inner circle around him, to his successes. The policies that had been spearheaded by Kaganovich were ingenious, Under his benevolent guidance the Germans had been rendered impotent to harm them. Under his guidance, the People's Republic would take its rightful place in the world, and he would take his rightful place in the stewardship of Russia. "

 ISH.14.t:0 "Passed Over!"
 ISH.14.d:0 "Rage. All he knew was rage. Lazar Kaganovich was pissed. After all the work and sacrifices that he put into protecting the people of the People's Republic he expected those people to recognize his efforts --to give him the recognition he was due.\n\nThat bastard Mikhail is taking credit for his work, the sheer scale of his efforts ignored in favor of his preaning egotist of a brother. He had worked too hard to be passed over like this, poured too much of himself into these projects, to save the people of Russia from the predations of the German dogs. Yet here he was, being ignored and scorned for his part in making Tyumen run like a well oiled machine.\n\nLazar seethed in his rage, simmering and stewing in his hate. The bastard had done nothing for the people that now practically cheered his name from the rooftops. How could this have happened? Didn't the people understand how much he had worked for their safety? How he had sacrificed so they would not have to? How could they do this? "
 ISH.14.a:0 "This is absurd!"

 ISH.15.t:0 "Escalate the Repopulation Program?"
 ISH.15.d:0 "It's a tragic piece of public knowledge that our population is suffering after decades of foreign and civil wars. For years, German planes have flown over our skies and targeted our people, killing soldiers and civilians, men, women and children indiscriminately. While it has undoubtedly caused a large degree of suffering throughout our lands, most terribly what this anarchy has done is cut down on our already-small population numbers through bombing attrition, bandit raids, and acts of god.\n\nA number of different solutions have been drafted to the so-called "repopulation problem", though one, above all, stands out. Women have, for some time, worked alongside men in certain roles that are fitting to them. This was done initially out of necessity, but as things are on their way to normalization, the added productivity that women bring to the workplace in terms of an extra set of hands is worth mentioning. On the other hand, however, it is the nature of women to bear children. If they're working, they can't bear children and vice-versa.\n\nIf we were to limit once more women's opportunity for work and work advancement until they have sired a requisite number of children, it would simultaneously encourage women to have children while not outright banning them from the workplace like some reactionary stooges may encourage. Certainly, we may see a drop in productivity as some women leave to bear children if we do opt to escalate this program, but we will see a noticeable increase in our birth rates.\n\nUltimately, the decision rests with the chairman."
 ISH.15.a:0 "No. We must make a stand for our sisters."
 ISH.15.b:0 "Do it. The future of Russia depends on us."

 ISH.16.t:0 "Revolutionary Crèches"
 ISH.16.d:0 "One of the more significant aspects of our repopulation program was the establishment of the so-called revolutionary creches, a network of civil organizations dedicated to the rearing and caring of children. These creches, under the watchful eye of the party, have also integrated a number of different education programs for both the children and the women who tend to them, creating a nest of future ideologues and Soviet zealots.\n\nHowever, a question has been raised regarding the specific administration of the creches. Their rapid success has caused a number of interest groups to lobby for control over them, with many seeing the creches as a path to success and importance in the future. Ultimately, Kaganovich and his closest advisors have convened to decide a way forward and announce who will have the ultimate control over these child rearing organizations. After what has seemed to be hours of deliberation, the group has narrowed the candidacy for control over the creches down to two potential prospects: the local communes and the military.\n\nThe local communes, if they had control over the creches, would ensure that children will be raised within their own communities, and be instilled with not only a sense of community importance and familial unity, but also receive the fair and necessary civilian education that should be available to every young man. On the other hand, if the military was to control the creches, they would end up much more centralized, growing up with a greater sense of identity than to their own community. On top of this, of course, the military would be interested, just as we would be, in raising a future generation of soldiers, raised literally from birth to fight and die for the Union.\n\nAs the night grew late, Kaganovich's advisory council waited with bated breath on his final decision..."
 ISH.16.a:0 "The military will administrate them."
 ISH.16.b:0 "Let each commune decide, within reason."

 ISH.17.t:0 "Rebuilding the Red Army"
 ISH.17.d:0 "Valeriy Konstaninovich Zima breathed the chilly, Siberian air. The officer in Kaganovich's army had known little more than bunkers and bombing drills for the past few years, and despite the fact that the wintery bite of the cold morning seemed to pierce him to the bone, he could barely feel it - the fresh air felt too good on his face and in his lungs. The long-time Soviet soldier looked over what he jokingly referred to his peers as his "flock", a rag-tag group of conscripts that were drawn from all sectors of society. There was Shvets, who came from a poor migrant family - his nose had been broken too many times and his slender frame and short stature betrayed his family's poverty and his malnourishment. Filippov, the son of a disgraced intellectual, who carried with him an air of undeserved snobbishness, and Vinogradov, whose plumpish frame told volumes about his background as the fourth son of a party official.\n\nThese three were but a few familiar faces in a crowd well over a dozen. Despite Zima's long service, he remained on a maddeningly low rung of the Republic's command structure. Zima watched over his troops attempting to form up and sighed, noticing the glaring flaws that his soldiers likely didn't even know were issues. There was a lot of work to do, Zima thought to himself. But as one soldier nearly bumped into another, Zima pushed his stress out of his mind and took another deep breath of fresh air - bunker air was the worst, he reminded himself.\n\nAs he exhaled, a sense of pride - something he had not felt in a long, long time - welled up within his chest. "Comrades!" he barked, pride overflowing from his body towards his charges. "It's time we learned the basics!""

 ISH.18.t:0 "Rolling On"
 ISH.18.d:0 ""Comrade Krevchenko, let's get this old girl running again shall we?"\n\nCaptain Yevgenovich opened the commander's hatch to peek out while Krevchenko, his driver, got to work. With a loud grunt from the engine, the old T-54 roared to life for the first time in several years. The memories of past battles and adventures came flooding back almost instantly to the Captain, who had always felt right at home sitting in a tank with his comrades. Now that the skies were clear, the Red Army could put their armor to work again. Leaning back down into the tank's interior, Captain Yevgenovich gave his driver a light shove with his foot to grab his attention.\n\n"Alright comrade, let's shake off the rust. Take us out of the warehouse, nice and easy." Krevchenko gave a nod in response, and Yevgenovich went back to his previous position. With yet another loud rev of the engine and a sharp movement that caused the Captain to jolt, the T-54 began to creep forward. Rolling out of the warehouse and into the sunlight of the outside, Captain Yevgenovich felt more powerful than ever before.\n\nThe tank may have been rather antiquated, but it worked like it was brand new. Several other soldiers had been standing around outside the warehouse, and they could not help but stare as the armored beast and its triumphant commander emerged. Younger recruits like them would likely have never seen a fully operational tank in action before, and the Captain knew that the sight must have been something to behold. The emboldened Yevgenovich now had a cheery look about him, giving an occasional wave to those who had come to observe. Finally, the old tanker was back where he belonged."

 ISH.19.d:0 ""Hey, Yuri, keep our speed up when we come up on that ramp, don't even think about slowing down. I want to see if we can make this thing fly!" Yuri heard his commander, who was shouting to get his voice across the incredibly loud interior of the tank, but did not turn to face him. To take his eyes off the course would be to invite disaster.\n\n"Are you sure that's wise, comrade?! The shock could kill all of us!"\n\n"We're in a tank, you fool! We'll be fine! Maintain our speed, Yuri!" As Yuri made a turn, the incline finally came into view. Against his better judgement, he decided to oblige with his commander's order. From the sidelines, the observing officers grew slightly concerned when the T-54 approaching the natural ramp did not slow down like usual.\n\nThe tank came to the slope, and as Yuri had feared the speed at which he was going caused the tank to soar through the air, if only for a second. The observers, meanwhile, watched in excitement and a little horror as the tank violently tumbled over the ramp. The impact could be heard over the engines of the other tanks navigating the obstacle course. After the tank had reacquainted itself with the ground, it remained completely still.\n\nFollowing a few tense moments, the tank resumed its relentless journey around the course, with sporadic cheers and claps erupting across the sidelines. Some of the older officers scoffed at the reckless nature of the stunt, but even they couldn't help but admire the spirit of the new recruits."

I want you to start today's lesson by throwing out anything you currently know about waging war with armor. I'm going to be frank: times have changed since the wars against the fascists, and to rely on old tactics would be nigh-on suicidal!"\n\nThe armored officers that had made up the class meticulously took notes as the general spoke. The room was overwhelmed by the sound of pencils at work.\n\n"Going into today's battlefields without being aware of what dangers are in store would be a total disaster. Man-portable rocket systems and specialized munitions give the enemy tank-killing power like you wouldn't believe. You must learn how to adapt in order to survive, comrades.\n\nTaking my words to heart during our little class today will be the deciding factor between rolling on to glorious victory, or perishing in fiery doom. Make no mistake comrades, you will be worse than useless to the Red Army if you die and take your expensive tanks with you, so be sure to pay attention!"\n\nThe officers were still scratching away at their notebooks, glancing up every so often to give their teacher the indication that they were, indeed, listening."

Eventually, he discovered his target. He put the binoculars away and signaled the rest of his squad. It was time to move out. A group of tanks hummed across the flat earth.\n\nThe bandit camp fell with little resistance. The shoddy, temporary tents were easily crushed by 25 tons of Soviet engineering. The bandits themselves put up a weak defense with small arms before scrambling off in all directions. A few were captured. Not as many as Captain Makarov would've liked, but the mission was still an overall success. The bandits wouldn't be able to terrorize the local villages without their supplies.\n\nAs the sun set in front of them and the bandit camp smouldered behind them, Captain Makarov and his tank squadron made the journey back to home base, eager to begin their next mission.

Exhausted from the day long military exercise, the warm afternoon sun lulled their sore muscles and heavy eyes into an innocent half-slumber in which the grass was soft and the day's work was nearly over. The whistle cracked their naive reality and they soon assembled in several rigid rows, ready to receive the words of their commander.\n\n"You call this your best!?" Kuznetsov spat.\n\nSeveral of the soldiers twitched, but none of them averted their forward gaze.\n\n"Will you be this lazy the next time bandits attack a village!? Will you sit back, light a cigarette, and watch them butcher women and children?!" he screamed at the men. "Well?

He held out his right hand to shake, his left arm holding his bag of clothes and personal effects by his side.\n\nThe captain he had been assigned to looked at Aleksey's hand as though there was a knife in it. He cautiously reached out to meet it and gave an uncomfortably short handshake.\n\n"Your bunk is right here." he said with a small cough. He gestured to the bottom bed of a bunk in the corner, far from any windows or other soldiers.\n\nAleksey nodded and walked calmly to his bed. He felt the eyes of his new comrades bore holes in his body as he passed by. He flashed each of them a smile and even waved to a couple. He arrived at his bunk and withdrew his various possessions including a small journal. As the men whispered and gossiped about him, Aleksey composed his first report on the morale of his company."

Osipova smiled at her and returned her gaze forward, stoic and brave, like any hero should be.\n\nShe was in a city square on a platform with several high ranking party members and, most importantly, Chairman Kaganovich. The flags of the West Russian People's Republic and Soviet Union were hung behind them.\n\n"We are here today to honor Comrade Valeriya Osipova for her bravery in saving an entire family from a German attack." the Chairman began, speaking into a microphone that projected his voice across the square. "Comrade Osipova risked her own life to rescue a family of five after their farm was bombed. She crawled through the ruins, freed them from the burning wreckage, and was even able to resuscitate one of the children, who would have died had she not been present. For her valiant actions, I hereby award Comrade Osipova Hero of the People's Republic."\n\nKaganovich pinned a simple, yet striking medal to her chest before he began to clap.

About Omsk. About him. Andrei held back memories as Karbyshev's aide, hear the tips about leadership and tactics. The sunlight in his eyes the day he returned, still scarred and bloodied.

It would be the end of our independence, but it would permanently resolve our resource shortages, and the civilian population would not need to sacrifice as much in order to maintain our planes. However, Kaganovich has not changed since his last offer, and our previous objections are still all too relevant. Is it better to live under a tyrant, or to die with our freedom intact?

All across our glorious nation, you can hear the people singing, the trumpets blaring, our men parading through the streets of welcoming cities, who welcome not only their liberation but a new Russian prosperity. All of them call out the same thing: Glory to Russia and glory to Kaganovich, her liberator! A united West Siberia is only the first step to a united Russia, and we believe that under our leader we will undoubtedly succeed.\n\nToday, Kaganovich spoke in front of a massive crowd in Tyumen and to crowds across West Siberia through loudspeakers, proclaiming the liberation of West Siberia and the reunification of the West Siberian People’s Republic. The people have won their greatest victory, he said to a jubilant audience, and now the people’s vanguard is in full control of West Siberia under the guidance of the party and her leader Lazar Kaganovich. From West Siberia there is no clearer path than to Russia’s liberation! The people’s government is here!"
 ISH.38.a:0 "For the Union!"

 ISH.39.t:0 "Into the Future"
 ISH.39.d:0 "The reforms are complete! There has never been a time in Soviet history when the developed forces of a nation were this strong, and now all of fractured Russia trembles at our might. Now standing as the liberators of Russia’s breadbasket, it is time we spread our revolution to the rest of the former Union to bring about new prosperity under the guiding hand of Kaganovich’s reforms. We have succeeded in spreading our reforms throughout all of our People’s Republic, and lands formerly owned by weak, reactionary warlords now are under the rightful command of Russia; her people, strong and united.\n\nThose who opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat have been dealt with as needed, the people work fervently for reunification, and now towns that were once insignificant dots on a map are industrial centers where steel turns into the tools of the people! From our new sturdy industrial base in West Siberia, the path to Russia’s reunification is clear: first the petty, squabbling Urals, and then West Russia, where resistance to the path of the revolution will be stronger than ever. Comrades, forward! For the Motherland, for Kaganovich!"

 ISH.40.t:0 "The Continuation of the Five Year Plan"
 ISH.40.d:0 "It was a skeleton of metal and wood at first. Wispy beams and fragile supports stuck out at odd angles, prompting curious looks from the citizenry. Children played in its rafters and dared each other to jump the gaps of the third floor.\n\nSlowly, however, the construct was assembled, piece by piece. One day, workers entered; Men and a few women, dressed in simple, pristine jumpsuits, took their positions in preparation for their first day on the job.\n\nThen the factory roared.\n\nAcross the West Siberian People's Republic, the industrialization effort yields victory after victory. The people have jobs. The stores have goods. The productive forces are developed. The barren Siberian wasteland, once composed of a few cottage industries and farms, is resurrected by the blazing fires of production.\n\nThrough the efforts of the people, the Party, and, of course, Comrade Kaganovich, the Revolution is advanced, and yet, as planners and architects scurry through state offices, as mechanical beasts vomit progress into the air, as workers tear and sully their new jumpsuits, this is only the beginning."

 ISH.41.t:0 "Lessons from the Past"
 ISH.41.d:0 "Marshal Ivan Konev inspected faded battleplans in the near darkness of a military archive. A single candle accompanied him. His hands traced the unfortunately inadequate tactics of commanders twenty years dead. Visualizations of the battles occurred over and over in his head, always reaching an identical conclusion: failure.\n\nWith decades of hindsight, it was simple to identify the mistakes of his comrades as well as himself. A division there. Reroute supplies here. Hold that point. The mental wars turned like an hourglass. Eventually, the sand ran out and Konev was left with a victory.\n\n"What could have been?" he thought. Then he shook his head. It was no use to dwell on alternate possibilities when an all too real war awaited him. The Russian traitors and German fascists wouldn't give him the luxury of knowing their moves before they made them.\n\nKonev's eyelids felt heavy. It was very late and it had become difficult to focus on the splotched ink and ambiguous handwriting. He gave a last look at the ancient tactics. They had failed once, but never again. This time, they must succeed. He reached for the candle and starved it of air with his forefinger and thumb, flooding the room with a thick darkness."
 ISH.41.a:0 "What can graves tell us?"

 ISH.42.t:0 "The Spectre"
 ISH.42.d:0 "A spectre is haunting Russia. The German Luftwaffe could not eradicate it. A holy alliance of fascists, reactionaries, and capitalists could not exorcise it. It cannot be undone by men of flesh nor machines of steel.\n\nThe spectre has begun to look far beyond our artificial borders. It trawls the dark continent of Europe, evading German police-spies and SS officers. It slithers among Asian rice fields where indigenous workers slave for Japanese corporations. It crawls through Africa, inspiring dreams of a free continent. It flies above South American jungles and watches for the tendrils of imperialism. It hides in the union halls and factories of North America, subverting the greatest fortress of capital. The spectre is haunting the world, and the world is terrified indeed.\n\nOur state is but a wisp of the spectre, acting as a single soldier in a global class war. Its role cannot be overstated, however. As an example to the international proletariat of real, working socialism, it falls to us to reach out to like minded movements, oppose reactionaries who threaten the Revolution, and bring the world closer to communism."

 ISH.43.t:0 "From Russia With Love"
 ISH.43.d:0 "The letter crossed mountains and seas. It slipped through the hands of fascists and censors. Protected by an official looking stamp and the no nonsense attitude of its hodler, the expensive paper made its way to the President's desk.\n\n"To the United States," it began. "A large portion of the anarchic Russian wasteland has returned to the fold of the legitimate Soviet government, led by Chairman Kagonovich, and the rest will soon follow. We are aware that the United States, despite its capitalist nature, stands against fascism across the world just as it did in the Second World War. Given the existential threats posed by the Japanese and German empires, it is in the interest of the legitimate Russian government that there be no animosity between our two peoples."\n\n"Be aware, however, that aggression towards Russia or actions that counteract the interests of international socialism will not be tolerated. Russia is reborn and she will make either a dangerous enemy or a valuable ally.\n\nThe Supreme Soviet of the USSR""

 ISH.44.t:0 "A Soviet Hello"
 ISH.44.d:0 "To our Kazahk comrades,\n\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has been resurrected under Chairman Kaganovich's direction and vision. We have undertaken the first steps towards building socialism within Russia, but we seek to construct a truly internationalist movement as well.\n\nAs a former member republic of the Union, we hope to foster a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship, with the possibility of restoring the Union in its entirety in the future. For now, however, we suggest a simple treaty of nonaggression in order to announce to the world our mutual willingness to advance international socialism.\n\nMuch of Russia is still consumed by chaos and ruled by reactionaries. The wider world is much the same. In these dark times, friendship and cooperation is the shield against annihilation."
 ISH.44.a:0 "We accept!"

 ISH.45.t:0 "Weapons From Kaganovich"
 ISH.45.d:0 "To our Kazahk comrades,\n\nIn the spirit of internationalism, we have delivered several shipments of armaments for your self defense against bandits and imperialist powers. The world is still a dangerous, dark place divided between three empires. At the fault lines where these spheres meet, conflict is sure to erupt.\n\nIn the coming years, as Russia rises under Chairman Kaganovich's guiding hand, your region will be sure to grow increasingly geo-politically prominent as well. The Revolution must be protected from both external and internal threats. We hope that this military aid serves your state well in the defense of socialism."
 ISH.45.a:0 "We accept!"

 ISH.46.t:0 "A Denunciation from the Urals"
 ISH.46.d:0 "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received notice of a public diplomatic condemnation from an entity calling itself the West Siberian People's Republic. This government, ruling from its seat in the eastern city of Tyumen, claims successorship to the fallen Soviet Union, and is led by Chairman of the Communist Party Lazar Kaganovich, who claims an \"anti-revisionist\" orientation. The message, undoubtedly authored with heavy influence from the Chairman, reads as follows:\n\n\"The Empire of Japan, one of the foremost imperialist powers on Earth, is one of the foulest enemies of the global proletariat. Under the guise of opposition to European imperialism, it has militarily occupied and incorporated into its \"Co-Prosperity Sphere\" a number of the countries of Asia, only to further their enslavement under its own rule. Its crimes include the invasion, occupation, and subjugation of China and the massacre of its inhabitants, the systematic extraction of the resources of Manchuria and Southeast Asia for its own ends, the widespread use of slavery in the form of the \"romusha\" and similar systems, the sponsorship of murderous fascists in the former Soviet Union, the suppression of people's movements in Japan and abroad, and too many other crimes to count. The Japanese bourgeoisie have effectively fused with the state and military apparatus to further the oppression and exploitation of the people of Asia, and in terms of the number of people under its rule alone Japan is the largest fascist regime in human history. It is the task of the world's workers to smash this horrid empire, and give the nations of the Co-Prosperity Sphere true self-determination.\"\nThe WSPR's stance, perhaps to be expected for a communist state, is extremely anti-Japanese. If Kaganovich is allowed to revive the Soviet Union, our control over the states of East Asia would become significantly harder to maintain."

 ISH.47.t:0 "Renewed Communist Hostility"
 ISH.47.d:0 "The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs has received notice that a Russian warlord state referring to itself as the \"West Siberian People's Republic\" has issued a diplomatic condemnation of the Greater German Reich. The Republic, reportedly steered by Chairman Lazar Kaganovich, a Jew, is headquartered in Tyumen and reportedly pushes a more aggressive economic policy than its Soviet predecessors. The message, a caustic screed expectedly filled with Bolshevik cliches, reads as follows:\nThe Greater German Reich is among the greatest imperialist powers in human history and perhaps the bloodiest. Its fascistic, hyper-reactionary, ideology has led it to commit the greatest genocide in human history: the extermination of Jews, Poles, Russians, Balts, and other peoples of Eastern Europe in the name of colonialism and imperial expansion. Through the widespread use of slavery, predicated on race lines, it has overseen the hideous exploitation of the labor of over forty million people in Europe alone, with its conquest of the old colonial territories in Africa expanding that number by millions more. The Soviet Union, a worldwide beacon of the workers' struggle, also fell prey to Germany's depredations, with incalculable costs to its people and the continued occupation of its core territories. The poisonous ideology of racism, which divides the working class only to imiserate them all, has seen no greater success in the world than here, and it ought to be the goal of the international workers' movement to tear down this fascist monstrosity and free the peoples of Germany and Eastern Europe alike.\"\nThe WSPR may rise to be a threat in the future, but as of now it is still weak and surrounded by enemies, its threats mere saber-rattling. Let it try to challenge the Reich's hegemony; no matter how many times the Bolsheviks rise against us, they will always fail."

 ISH.48.t:0 "Contact Central Asia"
 ISH.48.d:0 "After over a decade of isolation from any of their comrades in the other SSR's, Central Asian communists have received a very pleasant surprise: correspondence from the Russians! Diplomats and emissaries from the West Siberian People's Republic to the north have journeyed into the region, telling of sympathetic leadership to the north and a revitalized, state-driven communist system, with a leader keenly aware of the mistakes of the old Soviet Union. They promise that aid, trade, and better relations are just around the corner, as soon as the WSPR figures out the logistics of sending supplies through the still-turbulent countryside. In the meantime, they plead only for recognition, and an assurance that the Central Asians will work alongside them for the reconstruction of the Soviet Union when the time comes.\nFor the Central Asians, this offer certainly seems tempting. Aid to reconstruct their shattered, underdeveloped economies and arms to fight their petty border wars would certainly be welcomed. A connection to the outside world for the first time in years seems too good to be true. But there are always doubts; what happens if Tyumen makes demands that infringe upon their sovereignty? The rumors that trickle out of Tyumen paint \"Iron Lazar\" as far more controlling than the rosy picture his diplomats have painted of him might imply. Assuming the Central Asians decide to embark down the path of friendship with the Siberian strongman, they have much to look forward to, and much to be wary of."

 ISH.49.t:0 "Solidarity with Socialists"
 ISH.49.d:0 "Socialism across the world fell into darkness when the light of the USSR was extinguished. Now that it has been restored it falls to us to ensure that it never occurs again. The workers of the world must unite and share their knowledge, and to that end we must establish diplomatic communications with socialist governments across the globe.\n\nFrom the ports of the Far East and the Arctic, diplomats depart for brother nations across Africa, Asia and the Americas. Those nations less advanced along the path to communism will require guidance from their more experienced older brother."

 ISH.50.t:0 "Congratulate Compatible Governments"
 ISH.50.d:0 "While the light of socialism fell dim for years, there are some nations who have stayed true to the path despite the darkness. Isolation has made life in these nations difficult, surrounded on all sides by reactionary powers that seek to deny their existence. Now that the Soviet Union has returned, they can rest easy knowing that they have a friend and ally.\n\nThe construction of embassies in the capitals of our communist friends will do much to recognise the legitimacy of their government and build goodwill towards ours."

 ISH.51.t:0 "The Call of the Comintern"
 ISH.51.d:0 "For years socialist and communist organisations across the globe have been scattered and separated by the tyrannical empires that span the world. The renewal of the USSR provides a fantastic chance to end this isolation, to gather the world's brightest minds in one forum. While Moscow or Leningrad may no longer be the capitals of the revolution, Kaganovichgrad is ready to take up their mantle. The Kaganovichgrad Conference will discuss every aspect of socialism, from the world revolution to economic planning to high-level ideology."
 ISH.51.a:0 "The International is coming home."
 
 ISH.52.t:0 "Rise of the Cominform"
 ISH.52.d:0 "The diaspora of socialists that have arrived in Kaganovichgrad is incredible. Revolutionaries fighters from Africa rub noses with National Progressive Party members from America, Palestinian Arabs and Jews turn away from their opposite numbers with equal disdain, and British communists chat with their continental counterparts. The amount of information being shared is incalculable, but they were invited here for more than a polite discussion over tea and biscuits.\n\nAs the greetings turn to discussion, the delegates are steered towards the correct topic. With the end of the International a new organisation must rise to take its place. Comrade Kaganovich gave an impassioned speech on the importance of socialist brotherhood, receiving uproarious applause from the assembled delegates.\n\nWith that, Comrade Kaganovich proposed the establishment of an organisation that would coordinate socialist movements across the world under the benevolent guiding hand of the USSR. The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties will be an organisation that coordinates socialist movements across the world under the benevolent guiding hand of the USSR. Each government delegate is offered the chance to join, either as a full or an associate member."
 ISH.52.a:0 "The International has its successor."
 
 ISH.53.t:0 "A Delegation to Kaganovichgrad"
 ISH.53.d:0 "The invitation to attend the Kaganovichgrad Conference was a surprise one, for with the fall of Moscow and Leningrad none expected Russia to become home of the revolution once more. We are always happy to meet with our socialist brothers however, and with a delegation quickly assembled a plane was chartered for the Soviet Union.\n\nThe conference was impressive, despite the diminished state of the Union. Comrade Kaganovich clearly did his best to ensure that the loss of Moscow was not felt too keenly, and the gathering was as heavily attended as the Socialist International in the heyday of the revolution. Spanish anarchists and British Trotskyites, Cuban Leninists and Russian Stalinists, every denomination of leftist imaginable in attendance. Such a gathering of minds had not yet taken place this generation.\n\nThroughout it all was the constant presence of Lazar Kaganovich, shaking hands and making himself known. By the end of the night all would remember his name and he would know theirs. Say what you will of the man - and many did - but he is diligent."
 ISH.53.a:0 "And now for the final announcement..."
 
 ISH.54.t:0 "Welcome to the Cominform"
 ISH.54.d:0 "The fall of the Soviet Union left the smaller socialist nations of the world without allies in a hostile world. In the midst of the Conference, Lazar Kaganovich announced a plan for an organisation that would link the socialist world together once more - the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, which will coordinate socialist movements across the globe, sharing intelligence for the advancement of the workers of the world.\n\nAs a proud socialist nation a membership offer has been extended to us. While we have no greater desire than to aid the cause of socialism, there are those who suspect the motives of Kaganovich and the USSR."

 ISH.56.d:0 "The Kaganovichgrad Conference was a success, but our goals evidently do not fully align with those of the rest of the world. The nation of X has elected to join the Cominform as an associate member. This will entitle them an observer position on the affairs of the Bureau and preferential trading status, but they will not be entitled to the foreign aid and organisation granted to full members.\n\nWe can at least be confident they are no enemy to us."
 ISH.56.a:0 "It will be easier to keep an eye on them this way."
 
 ISH.57.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Refuses to Join the Cominform"

 ISH_khrushchev.1.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich tapped his foot on the airplane floor, hastily explaining to a young official the importance of the next 5-Year plan. The day is ruined, he thought as the craft landed in Tyumen, Khrushchev had better have a good reason for summoning me halfway across the country. The morning was fairly normal - Lazar adhered to his regular routine of a quick shower and breakfast before inspecting the new factories in the North. Everything was shattered when he received a report of unscheduled army movements, followed by an unplanned trip to the Party.\n\nThe airplane door opened, Lazar rushed into the field where five black cars awaited. Khrushchev exited, flanked by armed NKVD officers. Before the Chairman could react, his plane roared back to life and fled.\n\n'Comrade Koganovich,' began Khrushchev as a soldier handcuffed Lazar, 'you are charged with incompetence and treason against the Party. You have been found guilty by a general assembly this morning.'\n\nThe Chairman was stuffed into the car's backseat, struggling to describe his confusion and rage. Nikita continued, 'I have been appointed Chairman. Your tyranny will no longer haunt the people of Russia.' The door slammed and Lazar Kaganovich was no more."

The gulag's lights had been turned on to welcome the Chairman's visit, illuminating the night. A line of prisoners hurried towards the trucks where officers were distributing rations, a stark contrast to the other side of camp, where the old guard of the gulag was being deported.\n\nThe commotion quilted down when a group of soldiers formed a circle in the main square, all talking ceased when a man announced himself to be the president of the Soviet Union: 'Comrades, rejoice! The tyrant Kaganovich has been ousted from power, no longer shall you be forced to work in these camps!' Nikita Khrushchev summoned the attention of everybody now, his voice boomed through the falling snow: 'Our new Union is built upon justice, equality, freedom, not slavery and these gulags. Tomorrow my loyal officers will escort you back to your homes, but first eat your fill!' The crowd cheered, never before had Vladimir observed such happiness in the camp.

Khrushchev raised his fists, 'From now on, we will do everything in our power to reinforce the socialist dream! As we speak, prisoners are being freed from the icy gulags, the bureaucracy is undergoing cleansing, even the powers of the far West look more favorably towards us!'\n\nThe Party had indeed changed since the coup - some Tatars managed to obtain seats, there was more representation for women, and less NKVD officers listening to every conversation. A semblance of Soviet positivism had returned, not unlike that of the old Union.

Welcome!' For a moment the young man felt as if his legs couldn't support his weight, and no words left his mouth. 'Come, sit!' Khrushchev pointed to an empty chair beside him and held up a glass.\n\nAwed, Gregory sat down and looked at the statue. 'Ah yes,' Khrushchev turned back to the bust, 'that's Comrade Stalin. Do you know of him?' Gregory managed to shake his head.\n'A pity! What a fine man he was, could have shaped a Union that never was.' Nikita looked down, hesitating, 'Stalin believed in a country of iron, but also a country of justice. A place where everyone had bread and a roof, free from bourgeoisie decadence.'

The NKVD officer, a significantly younger fellow ordered to oversee his first execution, asked, 'Any last words, Comrade?' a phrase he often heard in the movies. Malinin sighed, straightened his cap, and, in a sudden change of character, shouted: 'Long live Comrade Kaganovich!'\n\n'Ready!' shouted the officer, 'Aim!' and the soldiers aimed. 'You dogs are only going to ruin the Union, you with your reforms! Russia is built on blood and steel! You, who would release the enemies of the State, who wo-'\n\n'Fire!'

What if there are still sympathizers among the Party? What if the committees push back against reforms? But the Chairman went on.\n\n'Comrades, hear, hear! I have with me a list of accusations and truths about Lazar Kaganovich. This list is by no means exhaustive, but I hope that it will enlighten you as to the covert crimes he has committed against the Union.' A couple gasps came from the assembly, Khrushchev eyed the TV camera in the corner. Now or never. And so he recited the list, talking of secret murders, kidnappings in the night, deportations to places unheard of, secret gulags not on any map. The Party and people listened in horror.

Russian literature, history books, and certain foreign novels had been burned, possession of which was punishable with a trip to the gulag. The committee will meticulously oversee the reintegration of literature into society, aided by recently freed intellectuals.\n\nAdditionally, foreign imports will need to be looked at. While our young reborn country lacks sufficient engineers and professors, we can rely on American texts to teach the next generation.
