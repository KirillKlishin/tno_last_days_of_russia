 USA_lbj_64_the_johnson_presidency:0 "Президентство Джонсона"
 USA_lbj_64_the_johnson_presidency_desc:0 "После более чем год напряженной предвыборной кампании, от праймериза до всеобщих выборов, президент Линдон Бейнс Джонсон сидит в Овальном кабинете. Проводя кампанию под смелыми лозунгами "великого общества", он планирует перестроить Америку любыми необходимыми средствами. Эти запланированные реформы представляют собой продолжение факела прогрессивизма Кеннеди и действительно изменят структуру нации, с широким законодательством о гражданских правах, медицинской помощью для всех и прекращением бедного состояния большей части страны. Кроме того, Джонсон также утверждает, что он будет совершенствовать Вооруженные силы, реформируя их в боевую машину, пригодную для современного мира.\n\nОднако прежде чем он сможет приступить к запланированному каскаду реформ, направленных на изменение структуры американского общества, он должен завоевать доверие нации. В своей инаугурационной речи Джонсон расскажет всей стране о своих планах и их будущем."
 USA_lbj_64_mistakes_of_nixon:0 "Ошибки Никсона"
 USA_lbj_64_mistakes_of_nixon_desc:0 "Администрация президента Никсона была, за неимением лучшего термина, катастрофической. Во время его президентства началась Южноафриканская война, борьба за гражданские права достигла апогея и Соединенные Штаты пережили худший президентский скандал за всю свою короткую историю. После его отставки, и все еще во время его срока, его преемник, Джон Ф. Кеннеди, был убит. Если Джонсон хочет вернуть доверие общественности не только к себе, но и к Республиканско-Демократической партии в целом, он должен заверить народ, что эти вопросы будут решены. Заверения в том, что война в Южной Африке будет выиграна, что будет достигнуто полное равенство рас и что не произойдет никакого скандала или коррупции."
 USA_lbj_64_legacy_of_kennedy:0 "Наследие Кеннеди"
 USA_lbj_64_legacy_of_kennedy_desc:0 "Президентство Кеннеди, хотя и трагически оборванное, представляло собой, возможно, лучшее, чем могли быть республиканцы-демократы. Его несколько коротких оптимистических месяцев были, возможно, самыми важными в определении будущего не только Р-ДП, но и Америки в целом. Точно так же, как мы предостерегаем от ошибок Никсона, если Р-ДП хотят выжить в своем нынешнем состоянии, мы должны также продолжить наследие Кеннеди. Президент Джонсон будет нести факел прогрессивизма и единства Кеннеди до тех пор, пока Америка снова не станет единой."
 USA_lbj_64_forwards_together:0 "Вперед вместе"
 USA_lbj_64_forwards_together_desc:0 "Пришло время двигаться вперед! Боль последних десятилетий, с нашим унижением и недоверием, которое наши граждане испытывают к правительству, должны закончиться. Эта страна должна лучше заботиться о своих гражданах и для этого мы должны попытаться разработать программу помощи всем американцам и дальнейшего объединения нашей страны в более Великое Общество. Более Великое Общество, которое помогает американцам всех классов, цветов кожи и убеждений, чтобы они не страдали из-за условий, которые не всегда находятся под их контролем. Вперед!"
 USA_lbj_64_secure_congress_support:0 "Заручиться поддержкой Конгресса"
 USA_lbj_64_secure_congress_support_desc:0 "Для того чтобы наша великая общественная программа прошла, нам нужен Конгресс. Мы должны обеспечить голоса в Палате представителей и Сенате, чтобы этот огромный законопроект попал на стол президента. Давайте сформулируем стратегию, чтобы обеспечить эти голоса. Возможно, мы сможем использовать кафедру в нашей собственной партии, чтобы привлечь к голосованию наших более нерешительных союзников. Или мы можем договориться с некоторыми из более умеренных членов НПП, чтобы этот законопроект был принят. В любом случае, давайте обеспечим необходимую поддержку для достижения успеха."
 USA_lbj_64_on_our_own:0 "Самодостаточность"
 USA_lbj_64_on_our_own_desc:0 "У нас большинство в Конгрессе. Давайте воспользуемся этим! Партия должна быть едина. Мы можем пообещать некоторым из наших более умеренных членов поддержать этот законопроект, если мы получим какой-то компромиссн. Скорее всего, мы потеряем несколько голосов на Юге, если добьемся принятия законопроекта о великом обществе, но это то, что потребуется, если это будет означать настоящую реформу. Хорошая новость также в том, что НПП не сможет остановить этот законопроект до тех пор, пока наша партия остается единой перед лицом обструкции. Недостатком является то, что НПП может подобрать более консервативных членов нашего электората после того, как мы обеспечим себе большинство в Конгрессе для принятия этого законопроекта."
 USA_lbj_64_deal_with_center:0 "Сделка с центром"
 USA_lbj_64_deal_with_center_desc:0 "Давайте посмотрим правде в глаза, у нас нет большинства среди нашей собственной партии, чтобы принять этот законопроект. Это выглядит тревожно. Однако нам повезло, что НПП разделена между крайне правым, крайне левым и даже умеренным крылом. Мы должны быть в состоянии заключить сделку с центральной фракцией НПП, чтобы сломать ряды остальной части НПП, для поддержки законопроекта. Нам просто придется пойти на некоторые незначительные компромиссы. Неудача с компромиссом с членами НПП заключается в том, что часть нашего собственного электората может перейти на сторону НПП, потому что многие из наших более умеренных членов увидят в этом оскорбление стабильных американских ценностей."
 USA_lbj_64_shut_up_and_help_me:0 "Для блага Америки"
 USA_lbj_64_shut_up_and_help_me_desc:0 "Мы собрали всех, кого могли, чтобы работать с нами - республиканцев, демократов, даже оппозицию к НПП. Если мы все работаем на благо Америки, тогда мы все должны быть на борту с лучшим образованием, сокращением бедности, улучшением здравоохранения и обеспечением свободы на нашей земле. Мы сделали свое дело перед Конгрессом - теперь они должны приступить к программе, для блага Америки!"

 USA_lbj_64_lay_groundwork_desc:0 "Политические аналитики, исследователи, экономисты и администраторы штатов, которые имели опыт в управлении внутренними программами, будут необходимы для подготовки величайшей реформы в американской истории. Мы должны собрать их всех, чтобы вместе с различными политическими комитетами, работающими в Конгрессе, начать вырабатывать политику. Давайте убедимся, что у нас есть счет, за который стоит бороться!"
 USA_lbj_64_introduce_concept:0 "Ввести понятие"
 USA_lbj_64_introduce_concept_desc:0 "Далее, мы должны начать знакомить общественность с идеей нашего законопроекта о великом обществе. Мы должны объяснить им, что наша идеальная цель - реформировать нашу страну, чтобы сделать ее более справедливой для всех американцев. Мы должны показать им, что в идеале хотим сделать каждого американца здоровее, счастливее и свободнее в своей жизни. Наше знакомство начнется в крупных университетах, крупных городах, на массовых площадках, чтобы люди были взволнованы нашим великим законопроектом. Люди должны быть взволнованы, чтобы общественная поддержка возросла."
 USA_lbj_64_form_task_forces:0 "Сформировать целевые группы"
 USA_lbj_64_form_task_forces_desc:0 "Затем мы должны детально изучить все американское общество в целом. Мы должны рассмотреть каждый отдельный аспект, начиная с образования, бедности, инфраструктуры, здравоохранения, социального обеспечения, искусства и так далее. Мы также должны сравнить эти аспекты и сопоставить наши планы с нашим текущим бюджетом, чтобы соответствующим образом скорректировать их. Как только наши исследования закончатся, все накопленные нами данные можно будет использовать для завершения окончательной формулировки законопроекта о великом обществе."
 USA_lbj_64_the_great_society:0 "Великое Общество"
 USA_lbj_64_the_great_society_desc:0 "Мои дорогие американцы, как ваш президент, я хочу объявить о начале новой эры. Последние 30 лет, прошедшие с момента нашего падения, были отмечены постоянным разочарованием в связи с прошлыми слабостями, которые Соединенные Штаты продемонстрировали нашему народу и всему миру. Американцы в те последние годы стали еще более бедными, больными, голодными, злыми, обиженными и смущенными из-за того, что наше правительство по-прежнему не помогает американскому народу процветать. Даже с учетом внешней угрозы со стороны свастики это не было оправданием для прошлого пренебрежения, которое проявляли администрации до нас. Но, несмотря на нашу борьбу в прошлом, сегодня совсем другой день. Сегодня новый день в американском обществе. День, когда все больше американцев смогут вырваться из нищеты и присоединиться к рабочей силе, чтобы лучше обеспечить себе свободу. День, в который заботы больных и страдающих могут быть смягчены медицинским страхованием, которое дается для будущего здоровья и радости. День, в который все народы в пределах этой страны могут стремиться к счастью. В целом, американский народ может процветать вечно с подписанием законопроекта о великом обществе. Наша великая общественная программа улучшит жизнь каждого американца и позаботится о том, чтобы их потребности были удовлетворены.\n-Президент Линдон Б. Джонсон"
 USA_lbj_64_more_civil_rights:0 "Расширение гражданских прав"
 USA_lbj_64_more_civil_rights_desc:0 "Теперь пришло время обратить наше внимание на наших соотечественников-американцев, которые уже давно страдают от угнетения. Ненавистные группы, которые причиняют им эти страдания, объединятся с нашим врагом, если они когда-нибудь вторгнутся в нашу страну и оккупируют ее. Поэтому мы должны быть бдительными и готовыми сражаться за наше черное население. Афроамериканцы должны быть свободны во всех аспектах, чтобы бороться с экстремизмом, и мы позаботимся о том, чтобы наше афроамериканское население было свободно, всеми возможными способами."
 USA_lbj_64_vote_in_hand:0 "Черные голоса"
 USA_lbj_64_vote_in_hand_desc:0 "Если мы хотим обеспечить будущий успех нашей партии перед лицом экстремизма со стороны НПП, мы должны обхаживать и помогать афроамериканскому сообществу в обеспечении того, чтобы они могли голосовать на всех выборах. Так много южных штатов в рамках Союза все еще делают все возможное, такие как тесты на грамотность,подушные налоги и даже массовые линчевания, чтобы помешать афроамериканцам осуществлять свое право голоса. Мы должны положить конец этому преступлению угнетения, которому мы, как партия, позволяли так долго гноиться. Если наша партия поддержит чернокожего американца, то чернокожие американцы будут счастливы и лояльны к Республиканско-Демократической партии на будущих выборах."
 USA_lbj_64_outlaw_literacy_tests:0 "Запретить тесты на грамотность"
 USA_lbj_64_outlaw_literacy_tests_desc:0 "Тесты на грамотность существовали с 1890-х годов, что бы афроамериканцы не могли голосовать из-за этого требования, чтобы они читали всю конституцию и умели читать великих классиков, что  не требовалось ни одному бедному белому южанину. Несмотря на то, что для американского населения важно уметь читать, чтобы быть более информативным о том, за кого голосовать, вся эта практика использовалась только для того, чтобы лишить афроамериканцев избирательных прав на юге и обеспечить продолжение голосования экстремистов, которые хотят разрушить американский образ жизни. Давайте напишем положение, которое запретит эти тесты раз и навсегда."
 USA_lbj_64_special_provisions:0 "Определение "Специальных Положений""
 USA_lbj_64_special_provisions_desc:0 "Законопроект об избирательных правах, возможно, содержит несколько других положений, которые гарантируют, что различные южные штаты не смогут принять изменения в избирательные законы, которые могут лишить избирательных прав и помешать афроамериканцам голосовать. Этим штатам потребуется федеральное одобрение для внесения изменений в закон о выборах. Это обеспечило бы больше черных голосов для Республиканско-Демократической партии, однако мы будем плохо выглядеть в глазах южных демократов. Реализация этих специальных положений, скорее всего, приведет в ярость белых южан, которые голосуют за нашу партию, и, возможно, вместо этого они перейдут в НПП. Это зависит от нас, чтобы решить, действительно ли мы хотим получить черные голоса, возможно, потеряв нашу белую южную базу."
 USA_lbj_64_voting_rights_act:0 "Закон об избирательных правах"
 USA_lbj_64_voting_rights_act_desc:0 "Закон об избирательных правах готов к принятию! Этот законопроект станет знаковым законодательным актом, который освободит больше нашего американского народа от правового гнета. Наш законопроект защитит избирательные права всех американцев, включая белых и расовые меньшинства всех цветов кожи! Тесты на грамотность, подушные налоги, различные положения о наказании и другие формы дискриминационного расизма в рамках нашего избирательного процесса будут ликвидированы. Многие белые американцы на Юге будут бушевать, но мы будем продвигаться вперед, мы станем более сильным Союзом, и в результате мы станем более сильным и лучшим народом. Многие штаты будут сопротивляться, но эти штаты подчинятся федеральному закону. Наша страна не может дрогнуть перед лицом расизма и фанатизма, и мы позаботимся об этом! За лучшее будущее для всех!"
 USA_lbj_64_once_more_unto_the_breach:0 "Еще одна попытка"
 USA_lbj_64_once_more_unto_the_breach_desc:0 "Предприятия и общественные учреждения юга будут следовать нашим новым законам. Мне все равно, сколько они будут плакать и кричать о федеральном "угнетении", они не помешают черным и другим меньшинствам получить доступ к бизнесу для необходимых покупок и общественным учреждениям для необходимой помощи в их повседневной жизни. Я лично отправлю федеральных наблюдателей, а если понадобится и национальную гвардию для обеспечения соблюдения закона, если у меня не будет выбора. Пора использовать трибуну в этих штатах."
 USA_lbj_64_beacon_in_darkness:0 "Маяк в темноте"
 USA_lbj_64_beacon_in_darkness_desc:0 "Наша страна должна стать маяком света для большего числа людей, которые хотят свободы от сапог фашизма и нацизма. Отвергнутые индивидуумы, которые часто оказываются в рабстве или убиты, должны быть спасены! Мы должны ослабить ограничения в рамках нашей нынешней иммиграционной системы, чтобы облегчить иммигрантам въезд в эту страну и упорно трудиться, чтобы стать американскими гражданами. Однако мы должны быть осторожны в том, как мы его реализуем, чтобы убедиться, что процесс не станет хаотичным и, возможно, не нанесет ущерба стране. Открытие шлюзов может помочь многим людям, но это может позволить нацистским шпионам легко проникнуть внутрь. С другой стороны, если мы все еще остаемся слишком ограничительными, мы все еще отчуждаем больше людей. Давайте убедимся, что мы выбрали правильное решение."
 USA_lbj_64_reshuffle_police_forces:0 "Кадровые перестановки в полиции"
 USA_lbj_64_reshuffle_police_forces_desc:0 "Государственные и местные полицейские силы в различных мятежных штатах на Юге будут следить за тем, чтобы федеральные и новые законы штатов соблюдались. Прошлое вынужденное незнание закона, а также поощрение полицейской жестокости в отношении афроамериканцев со стороны нашей местной и государственной полиции является откровенно преступным. Этот гнет будет демонтирован. Я лично пошлю федеральных следователей, чтобы полицейские департаменты либо сами изменили свои действия, либо заставили Штаты уволить массу непослушных полицейских, которые остаются жестокими по отношению к афроамериканцам и отказываются применять закон, когда он не устраивает расистского Южанина. Трибуна должна постоянно использоваться."
 USA_lbj_64_for_those_worthy:0 "..Для тех, кто достоин"
 USA_lbj_64_for_those_worthy_desc:0 "Даже если мы должны быть маяком надежды и свободы, мы не можем просто полностью открыть границы для каждого человека на планете. Вместо этого мы должны рассмотреть вопрос об исключении определенного количества людей на основе отсутствия навыков, которые могут быть проблематичными для безопасности нашей страны. Все элементы возможного морального дефекта со стороны иммигрантов должны быть проверены и, возможно, исключены, если это представляет угрозу национальной безопасности. Но если мы действительно рассматриваем возможность исключения некоторых людей на основе субъективной морали, мы наносим ущерб потенциалу нашей собственной страны. Это решение должно быть принято в отношении всех вариантов."
 USA_lbj_64_immigration_nationality_act:0 "Закон об иммиграционных и национальных службах"
 USA_lbj_64_immigration_nationality_act_desc:0 "Этот законопроект обеспечит возможность въезда большего числа иммигрантов. Но их поступление будет основано на достойной квалификации, которая может сделать их потенциальными американцами. Такие квалификации, как образование, необходимые навыки и т. д., будут востребованы, чтобы убедиться, что они получают приоритет в нашей новой системе. Еще одно важное положение этого закона даст иммигрантам более четкий путь для натурализации. Наконец, расовая квалификация полностью устраняется, чтобы обеспечить более справедливую и справедливую систему въезда, которая отражает моральный облик всей этой страны. Давайте сделаем эту иммиграционную систему более справедливой и справедливой для будущих американцев всего мира!"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head:0 "Крыша над головой"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head_desc:0 "Мы не можем допустить, чтобы американцы, принадлежащие к меньшинствам, больше страдали от дискриминации в сфере жилья. Афроамериканцы, мексиканцы и азиаты, все страдают от постоянной дискриминации, несмотря на их тяжелую работу по продвижению вверх. Большинство из них живут в трущобах, в нищете или на улицах, где они в конечном итоге создают проблемы для всех нас. Несмотря на то, что многие из наших белых американских избирателей не хотят иметь с ними ничего общего, позволяя цветным страдать в нищете, мы не только заставим нашу страну продолжать выглядеть плохо, но и, возможно, не сможем полностью обеспечить поддержку нашей партии со стороны этих новых избирателей на следующих выборах. Я умоляю моих коллег-республиканцев и демократов поддержать закон о справедливом и жилищном строительстве не только ради нашей коалиции, но и ради Америки."
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots:0 "Используйте беспорядки в гетто"
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots_desc:0 "Посмотрите на этот хаос! Грабежи, разрушения и насилие разрушили так много наших великих городов. И эти грабежи и разрушения происходят из афроамериканских гетто, которые остались нищими, в нищете и крайней нищете благодаря неспособности нашей нынешней партии разрешить этот кризис. Мы должны сделать что-то, чтобы успокоить гнев и ярость чернокожего сообщества, а также предотвратить дальнейшее насилие между другими американцами всех цветов кожи. Беспорядки демонстрируют нынешние неудачи нашего правительства, поскольку мы остаемся в стагнации с законопроектом. Это бездействие должно прекратиться, иначе наши чернокожие граждане окажутся в опасности в будущем."

 USA_lbj_64_yes_in_my_backyard_desc:0 "Теперь я понимаю беспокойство о менее удачливых людях, которые входят в ваши прекрасные пригородные дома и прекрасные кварталы. Может быть, вы боитесь, что они дадут вашему району дурную славу, или что они вызовут неприятности, или что они даже не смогут вписаться и в конечном итоге исключат вас из общества. Однако этого не произойдет! Если вы сможете убедить своего конгрессмена поддержать закон о справедливом жилье, вы можете быть уверены, что менее удачливые смогут подняться до вашего собственного уровня с их тяжелой работой и самоотверженностью. Те обездоленные люди, которым в конечном итоге будет легче переехать, станут вашими друзьями и, если уж на то пошло, сделают ваш район сильнее. Я умоляю вас как хорошего и доброго американского гражданина помочь менее удачливым в их борьбе за независимую и счастливую жизнь. Давайте скажем "Да" для еще более сильного заднего двора!"

 USA_lbj_64_the_FHA_desc:0 "Мы зашли так далеко в вопросе гражданских прав, но нам нужно закончить работу. Закон о справедливом жилищном строительстве, если нам удастся протолкнуть его, станет последним большим законодательным достижением этой администрации в дебатах о гражданских правах. Запретив любую и всякую дискриминацию при аренде и продаже жилья, мы увидим глубокие изменения в характере наших городов и поселков.\n\nМасштаб изменений, которые принесет закон о справедливом жилье, и его статус как последнего "Великого" законопроекта о гражданских правах этой администрации, сделали его центром политической бури. Сегрегационисты рассматривают жилищный вопрос как последний большой бастион против "насильственной десегрегации" и будут выступать против законопроекта так сильно, как только смогут. Многие в нашей собственной партии поощряют компромисс, чтобы предотвратить обширные последствия с консервативными избирателями. Тем временем афроамериканцы смотрят на Белый дом, чтобы увидеть, так ли хорош президент, как его слово.\n\nЛюбой наш выбор будет иметь последствия, но выбирать мы должны."

 USA_lbj_64_war_on_poverty_desc:0 "Нищета была огромным бременем для нашего общества и преследовала Соединенные Штаты с самого начала промышленной революции. Как в наших городах, так и в большинстве сельских общин миллионы людей живут в нищете. Отсутствие экономических возможностей подвергает поколения американцев бесконечному циклу трудностей. Нет больше! Сейчас Соединенные Штаты находятся в состоянии войны с врагом более древним и неуловимым, чем любая нация: самой бедностью. С помощью новых программ и инициатив мы будем искоренять бедность, чтобы все могли добиться успеха благодаря помощи правительства."

 USA_lbj_64_community_action_initiative_desc:0 "Разговоры на национальном и федеральном уровнях о полной борьбе с бедностью хороши, но только через мобилизацию общин по всей стране мы можем получить рабочую силу, необходимую для борьбы с экономическим упадком. С помощью новых информационно-пропагандистских программ, которые поощряли бы участие как на местном, так и на общественном уровне, мы можем предоставить новые возможности бедным, чтобы никто не боролся за выживание. Федеральное правительство будет служить направляющей рукой, ведущей обедневшие общины, где бы они ни находились, к процветанию."

 USA_lbj_64_job_corps_desc:0 "Уровень безработицы среди молодежи в Соединенных Штатах вызывает большую озабоченность как у президента, так и у Министерства труда. В еще одном проекте, дополняющем систему предлагаемых социальных и пропагандистских программ, мы стремимся создать Корпус Занятости. Эта организация при более крупном Министерстве труда будет обеспечивать образование, чтобы подготовить американскую молодежь для множества областей, а также работать, пока они не смогут снова встать на ноги. Большая часть их службы будет потрачена на улучшение национальных парков, обнищавших общин и других районов, которые попали под ответственность федерального правительства. Будем надеяться, что программа обеспечит жизненно важную подготовку и опыт для тех, кто в ней больше всего нуждается."

Подобно корпусу мира, ВОСЛА предоставляет своим членам стабильный доход, медицинскую страховку и множество других льгот в обмен на добровольческую службу. Реципиенты не только увидят другие области за пределами своих сообществ, но и приобретут навыки, необходимые для выполнения многих ролей, предписанных современной индустриальной экономикой.

В районах, где в настоящее время осуществляется программа, бедняки пользуются большим доступом к продовольствию, поскольку им больше не приходится бороться за объедки. Этот эксперимент имел свои недостатки, административная нагрузка оказалась выше, чем мы ожидали. Кроме того, было трудно обеспечить, чтобы марки были розданы всем, кто в них нуждается. Поскольку мы продолжаем расширяться, нам придется следить за тем, чтобы исправить эти перегибы в программе.\n\nВ свете успеха программы пришло время выйти на общенациональный уровень. Мы немедленно начнем экспансию в новые штаты. Очень скоро вся страна получит доступ к программе продовольственных талонов. С этим шагом наша война с бедностью будет еще ближе к победе."

Нередко граждане теряют работу и оказываются за чертой бедности, не имея возможности найти новую работу. Мы не можем допустить, чтобы наш народ остался на обочине, покинутый и забытый.\n\nПрезидент Джонсон представит новый законопроект, направленный на борьбу с этими проблемами. Закон об экономических возможностях начнется с увеличения субсидий по безработице и предоставления государственной помощи в поиске новой работы. Мало того, закон поможет тем, кто уже работает, повысив федеральную минимальную заработную плату. Этот новый законопроект покажет людям, к чему мы стремимся, проложив путь для дальнейшего законодательства."

Какими бы полезными ни были эти программы, мы постоянно тормозились бесконечной бюрократией, вовлеченной в выполнение этих программ на государственной основе. Если мы хотим охватить наибольшее число людей, нам придется начать сокращать бюрократическую волокиту.\n\nОбъединение всех наших программ под эгидой федерального правительства, несомненно, приведет как к снижению административной нагрузки, так и к снижению общих затрат. Однако многие увидят в этом расширение федеральной власти, когда мы возьмем контроль из рук Штатов. В более консервативных частях нашей страны это вряд ли будет популярной мерой."

Программа "Великое Общество" протянула руку и сделала Америку лучше, и все же мы можем сделать ее еще лучше.\n\nПрограмма "Великое Общество" была создана, чтобы помочь всем американцам, независимо от вероисповедания, пола или расы. Пришло время начать оказывать помощь обездоленным в нашей стране. Мы начнем работу над законодательством, которое позволит меньшинствам, женщинам и всем тем, кто подвергается дискриминации, искать лучшую работу, лучшее образование. Независимо от того, что некоторые могут чувствовать, мы не позволим ни одному американцу остаться позади на нашем пути к будущему."

Если мы действительно хотим освободить людей от оков прошлого, мы должны внести поправки в наше существующее законодательство о гражданских правах, чтобы также обеспечить конкретную правовую защиту экономически обездоленных.

Кроме того, гораздо больше молодых американцев могут поступить в колледж, так как федеральные стипендии сейчас в изобилии. Однако, несмотря на все эти положительные стороны, закон о высшем образовании предусматривает увеличение финансирования образования лишь на несколько лет.

 LBJ.1.desc:0"«Мои соотечественники: в данном случае клятва, которую я дал перед вами, это не та, которую я даю один, а та, которую мы даем вместе. Мы - одна нация и один народ. Мы можем иметь разные цвета или говорить на разных языках, но знамя, за которым мы следуем, остается тем же самым. Мы все американцы, и как таковые, мы должны работать вместе для дальнейшего улучшения нашей страны; работать вместе для создания великого общества».\n\n«За последние несколько десятилетий жизнь в Америке сильно сократилась: рецессии 30-х и 50-х годов, потери в мировой войне, соглашения Акаги и так далее. Наша нация так долго сталкивалась с трудностями и так много страдала, что легко забыть, кем мы когда-то были и кем могли бы стать. Америка в целом сильна, но ее народ не видит этого. В стране огромного богатства семьи не должны жить в безнадежной нищете. В стране, богатой урожаем, дети просто не должны голодать. В стране чудес исцеления соседи не должны страдать и умирать. В великой стране знаний и прогресса молодые люди должны учиться читать и писать. В Великом обществе люди имеют равные возможности и права на жизнь, свободу и стремление к счастью».\n\n«В настоящее время Америка не отражает этот идеал великого общества; политики в Вашингтоне голосуют по партийным линиям, а не по убеждениям или принципам; меньшинства нашей нации все еще трудятся под большой дискриминацией; и более четверти страны живет в нищете. Я говорю вам сейчас, Америка: этого не может быть. Я служу этой стране более 30 лет своей жизни. Я боролся с этой тратой нашего потенциала, нашей свободы и нашего огромного богатства, но я не могу сделать это в одиночку. Сегодня я повторю то, что сказал в тот печальный ноябрьский день прошлого года: я буду руководить и сделаю все, что в моих силах. Но вы, Америка, вы должны искать в своих сердцах руководства к старым обещаниям и старым мечтам. Идеалы старой Америки станут кредо новой. Да благословит Бог вас всех, и да благословит Бог эту великую нацию»."

 LBJ.2.desc:0 "По мере того как президент Джонсон готовит почву для своего "великого общества", он обнаружил, что путь к реализации его видения может оказаться более трудным, чем он думал. Многие из более консервативных демократов вряд ли благосклонно отнесутся к таким широким правительственным программам, а ультраправые наверняка будут выступать против многого из того, что он планирует, из чистого принципа, независимо от того, насколько хорошо он это излагает. С равновесием сил в Сенате, более шатким, чем когда-либо, все, что потребуется, - это несколько голосов оппозиции, чтобы заблокировать его планы и сорвать все, над чем он работал.\n\nОднако в Сенате есть сила, которая, возможно, захочет помочь президенту. Центр НПП разделяет многие основные убеждения президента, а лидер Центра Роберт Ф. Кеннеди страстно высказывался о состоянии бедности в Америке в прошлом. По этой причине президент Джонсон обдумывал возможность соглашения между республиканцами-демократами и центристами. В обмен на некоторые уступки Центру они, несомненно, будут готовы дать Джонсону голоса, необходимые ему для принятия любых мер, которые он пожелает, и осуществления Великого Общества в полном объеме.\n\nЕдинственная проблема - это шум, который это, скорее всего, вызовет в его собственной партии. После многих лет раскола между двумя партиями, вероятно, будет много ужаса от идеи партнерства, особенно со стороны демократического контингента партии. Однако после долгих размышлений президент Джонсон решил, что это лучший курс действий, и намерен написать длинное письмо Роберту Кеннеди, предлагая оливковую ветвь, излагая множество способов, которыми партнерство может принести плоды не только друг для друга, но и для Америки."

Кеннеди многие члены Р-ДП выражали свой гнев по поводу того, что президент хочет "лечь в постель с нашими политическими врагами." Вице-президент Маккалох сегодня, как сообщается, зашел так далеко, что предположил, что дальнейшее продвижение по этому пути сотрудничества "было бы серьезным предательством союза между республиканцами и демократами". Он уже начал убеждать сенаторов-демократов, что любое сотрудничество с Центром будет осуществляться исключительно на основе удобства и что он ни в коем случае не будет нарушать принципы республиканцев-демократов в интересах получения их поддержки. Это утихомирило некоторый ропот, но все еще есть некоторые опасения относительно того, что именно Центр потребует за свою помощь.\n\nРоберт Ф. Кеннеди еще не дал официального ответа на послание президента, хотя многие политические эксперты сходятся во мнении, что это лишь вопрос времени, поскольку это первый реальный шанс для НПП почувствовать вкус власти после их поражения на выборах всего несколько месяцев назад. Некоторые даже отметили иронию в том, что президент-республиканец снова работает с Кеннеди."

 LBJ.4.t:0 "Джонсон и Кеннеди"
 LBJ.4.desc:0 "Роберт Кеннеди положительно отреагировал на предложение президента Джонсона о сотрудничестве и согласился встретиться с ним в Белом доме для обсуждения условий соглашения между их сторонами. Встреча началась довольно приятно, когда Кеннеди нашел время, чтобы похвалить некоторые из предложенных Джонсоном реформ, и дополнил его своей готовностью протянуть руку, чтобы сделать то, что было правильно для страны.\n\nОднако Кеннеди ясно дал понять, что от этого соглашения он хочет не только хороших идей и начал излагать список условий, составленный как им самим, так и другими сенаторами-центристами, которые он потребует для заключения любого соглашения. Некоторые из этих вопросов были в основном совместимы с намеченным курсом президента Джонсона, но все же возникла проблема. Главное требование, Кеннеди настаивал, что без него он не сдвинется с места, состояло в том, чтобы президент сделал больше для решения текущей проблемы гражданских прав, при этом Кеннеди с грустью признал, что его покойный брат не сделал достаточно, чтобы действительно закончить работу.\n\nХотя президент Джонсон не обязательно был против этого, он знал, что расширение сферы действия законодательства о гражданских правах не будет хорошо сочетаться с более консервативными демократами и вполне может привести некоторых из них к ультраправым позициям. Таким образом, двое мужчин спорили в течение многих часов, причем Джонсон выражал свою озабоченность, а Кеннеди пытался предложить приемлемые компромиссы, но никогда не отклонялся от этого главного требования. В конце концов, оба человека согласились на сделку, которая, по их мнению, была разумно подходящей для них обоих, с президентом Джонсоном, согласившимся на основные требования Кеннеди в обмен на некоторые уступки. Однако еще предстоит выяснить, будет ли эта сторона так же одобрять сделку."

НПП нет места в этой правящей коалиции, о чем я могу напомнить всем присутствующим здесь сегодня - это коалиция между Республиканской партией и Демократической партией. Если президент Джонсон продолжит идти по этому пути, я не могу с уверенностью сказать, что могу поддерживать союз между нашими партиями и дальше и я уверен, что многие из моих коллег-демократов могут согласиться».\n\nЭти слова с едва сдерживаемым гневом произнес сегодня сенатор-демократ Уоллес Ф. Беннетт, и они были повторены многими внутри партии. Соглашение между президентом Джонсоном и Центром Кеннеди вызвало гнев демократов, которые рассматривают намерение президента иметь дело с Центром, а не своими собственными демократическими партнерами как акт предательства. Кроме того, его обещание пересмотреть вопрос о гражданских правах, как сообщается, привело к тому, что некоторые из более консервативных сенаторов тихо обменялись словами с ультраправым крылом НПП, возможно, рассматривая вопрос о том, могут ли они найти лучшее руководство и представительство под своим знаменем.\n\nЭтот внутренний кризис быстро становится еще одним препятствием для планов президента Джонсона в отношении страны. Хотя некоторые отмечают, что он, безусловно, встряхивает в значительной степени застойный политический театр, реальность для президента это гораздо большая головная боль. Поскольку меньшая, но тем не менее значительная часть его партии угрожает прямым разрывом с коалицией, ему нужно будет найти способ либо успокоить демократов, либо держать их в узде, если он хочет, чтобы его молодое президентство сохранило власть, чтобы делать то, что он считает необходимым."

 LBJ.6.desc:0 "В последние несколько дней президент Джонсон упорно трудился, пытаясь сгладить раскол между демократами и самим собой. В смеси частных разговоров и публичных выступлений он предпринял яростное наступление обаяния, используя свою политическую харизму, чтобы убедить своих коллег-политиков, что он на их стороне. Он ясно дал понять, что, хотя он полностью намерен работать с центром, чтобы провести некоторые важные реформы, он твердо верит, что связь между республиканцами и демократами важнее, чем когда-либо, и он сделает все возможное, чтобы эта связь сохранялась.\n\nОднако Джонсон также занял более агрессивную и напористую позицию по отношению к некоторым из наиболее упрямых демократов, которые все еще считают его недостойным возглавлять их. Часто напоминая о том, что популярность демократов до сих пор не восстановилась после поражения во Второй мировой войне, Джонсон тонко напомнил демократам, что их партия была бы обречена на бесполезность к настоящему времени, если бы не была создана коалиция республиканцев и демократов. Это в сочетании с некоторыми другими довольно бычьими заявлениями, некоторые из которых могут быть истолкованы как мягкие угрозы в адрес некоторых сенаторов, заставило некоторых из самых громких оппонентов внутри партии заметно замолчать в последние дни.\n\nНа данный момент, похоже, демократы успокоились, и сделка президента Джонсона с Центром НПП теперь вызывает не больше ужаса, чем дикие спекуляции в средствах массовой информации. Хотя драма, возможно, и утихла, однако она ясно показала, что в республиканцах-демократах начинают проявляться трещины. Партия пока выживает, но кто может сказать, что ждет ее в будущем?"

Разве это не вся ваша предвыборная платформа? Реформировать американскую политическую систему и создать "великое общество"?"\n\n«В свое время, Уолт», - ответил Джонсон, подписывая очередной документ и откладывая его в сторону.\n\n«Значит, вы собираетесь разорвать сделку с демократами позже?"\n\n«Может быть», - сказал он, «а может быть, они все равно проголосуют вместе с нами. Может быть, я получу достаточно голосов, чтобы проигнорировать их и продолжить свои планы».\n\n«При всем уважении, сэр, но я не думаю, что демократы просто позволят вам это сделать. Они поднимут большой шум».\n\n«Вы когда-нибудь пытались успокоить паникующую лошадь или, что более уместно, мула? Нужно подходить медленно и обходить его только тогда, когда вы уверены, что он вам доверяет. Политика это почти то же самое. На данный момент мы все еще на подходе».\n\n«Это может сработать, но что, если нет?"\n\n«Одно за другим, - ответил Джонсон, «пока что им придется обнять наших слонов, а мне целоваться с этими ослами»."

Проведете здесь достаточно времени, и люди это заметят. Что вам нужно?»\n\nДжонсон сел за красивый столик напротив Джексона. «Мне понадобится ваша помощь», - начал он, «демократы не будут вечно довольствоваться моими реформами, а когда они отрнутся, мне понадобятся голоса центристов».\n\n«Что нам от этого будет? Почему я должен помогать вам раскачивать центр?»\n\n«Почему бы и нет - вот вопрос получше; поддерживая мои реформы, вы получаете все, о чем просили, и даже больше».\n\n«И о чем именно мы "просили"?»\n\n«Гражданские права, всеобщее здравоохранение, более широкое социальное обеспечение и около сотни других вещей».\n\nДжексон на мгновение задумался. «Если я собираюсь помочь тебе, ты должен помочь мне.

Поклявшись перестроить страну "в наших городах, в нашей деревне и в наших классах", президент выразил твердое убеждение, что Великое Общество-это именно то, что нужно нашей стране в эти трудные времена.\n\nЕго речь вызвала аплодисменты присутствующих республиканцев-демократов, однако его планы не лишены оппозиции. Поскольку война в Южной Африке все еще бушует, многие задаются вопросом, сможет ли Америка позволить себе предлагаемые президентом программы в дополнение к деньгам, исчезающим в этой трясине. Кроме того, некоторые голоса среди ультраправых НПП и демократов ропщут, что многие инициативы Джонсона были бы грубым превышением государственной власти, и по крайней мере один ультраправый сенатор, как сообщается, осудил его как "жаждущего власти протофашиста"."\n\nВ течение следующих нескольких месяцев президент Джонсон намерен принять множество законопроектов, направленных на реализацию его видения. Это будет долгий, трудный процесс, и, безусловно, потребуется заключить больше сделок, чтобы заручиться поддержкой, необходимой для принятия этих законопроектов.

Несмотря на ожесточенную оппозицию со стороны ультраправых партий и приглушенное ворчание внутри демократов, нам уже удалось определиться с рядом этих положений. Это включает в себя запрет на осуществление любого вида избирательного ценза, предварительного условия или любого другого акта вмешательства в право человека голосовать по признаку расы, цвета кожи или языка.\n\nВозникла дискуссия по вопросу о некоторых специальных положениях, которые могут быть добавлены к законопроекту. Эти положения включают в себя законодательное требование ко всем юрисдикциям предоставлять избирательные материалы избирателям на нескольких языках, разрешение федерального надзора в любом штате или на местном уровне вносить изменения в избирательное законодательство, а также назначение федеральных экспертов для надзора за регистрацией избирателей, чтобы убедиться в том, что эти положения выполняются. Дебаты стали ожесточенными, причем ультраправые НПП и некоторые демократы утверждают, что эти положения равносильны федеральной тирании, в то время как Центристская НПП настаивает на том, что они абсолютно необходимы для защиты избирательных прав наиболее уязвимых слоев населения Америки. Многие республиканцы тем временем утверждают, что лучше всего было бы пойти на компромисс, разрешив некоторые специальные положения в обмен на некоторые консервативные поправки.\n\nНасколько сильны эти положения, если они вообще будут реализованы, нужно будет решить до того, как мы сможем вынести законопроект на голосование.

Десятки протестов были организованы по всей бывшей Конфедерации, в таких городах, как Атланта, Монтгомери, Новый Орлеан и Саванна. Весь этот гнев можно приписать двум людям, в частности: сенатору строму Тёрмонду и губернатору Алабамы Джорджу Уоллесу. Эти два человека натравили белое население на президента Линдона Джонсона после недавних заявлений о том, что его реформы "Великого Общества" будут включать всеобъемлющее законодательство о гражданских правах.\n\nГлубокий Юг уже давно является сильным приверженцем П-НПП и, в меньшей степени, более консервативных демократов. Как таковые, они всегда имели репутацию сопротивленцев законодательству о гражданских правах, но не до такой же степени. На данный момент неизвестно, почему Стром Тёрмонд и Джордж Уоллес выступили с таким крайним протестом, и только время покажет, окажет ли это какое-либо реальное влияние на решения президента.\n\nСам президент, несмотря на яростные протесты южан, заявил, что "Великое Общество включает в себя равенство для всех людей, независимо от расы, цвета кожи или вероисповедания".

Он обеспечивал лишь умеренную защиту избирательных прав чернокожих и предусматривал очень медленный процесс десегрегации. В целом, более либеральные и прогрессивные элементы нации находятся в смятении, но не больше, чем Центр-НПП.\n\nЛидеры Центра, включая бывшего кандидата в президенты Роберта Кеннеди и сенатора Ковша Джексона, осудили принятие законопроекта президента Джонсона и приказали своим сторонникам "не прекращать настаивать на истинном равенстве". Они утверждают, среди прочего, что новый законопроект просто ослабляет Движение за гражданские права, делая его более умеренными последователями, в то время как реальные проблемы действительно не решаются. Когда его попросили прокомментировать ситуацию, президент Джонсон просто отверг протестующих как "разгневанных радикалов, скулящих по поводу компромисса, который работает для всех" , и что "Великое Общество включает в себя равные права, но также требует здоровых, стабильных переходов к этому равенству"."

Законопроект, который вызвал ожесточенное голосование в Сенате между прогрессистами и ультраправыми и республиканцами, широко критиковался первыми за отсутствие глубокой защиты чернокожих и их обездоленных общин.\n\nТеперь, похоже, многие чернокожих разделяют это чувство, поскольку десятки тысяч людей начали демонстрацию рано утром, называя президента, среди прочих, "предателем". Однако во многих городах, особенно в Лос-Анджелесе и Бирмингеме, губернаторы штатов направили полицию и Национальную гвардию для разгона протестующих. Однако все быстро переросло в насилие, когда протестующие использовали импровизированное оружие для отпора, а также самодельные щиты из колпаков и крышек мусорных баков, чтобы блокировать пожарные шланги, которыми полиция пыталась их разогнать. К концу дня сотни магазинов, автомобилей и общественных зданий были разрушены или сожжены.\n\nПо-видимому, наиболее ожесточенными были бои в Бирмингеме, где, по-видимому, местное отделение Ку-Клукс-Клана вмешалось, когда демонстрации стали жестокими. Члены клана заключили временный союз с начальником полиции, ответственным за операцию, и вскоре обрушились на протестующих с дубинками и другим оружием.

Однако наша администрация обратила внимание на то, что во многих городах по всей Америке сегрегированные районы остаются из-за крайних полицейских предрассудков; что чернокожие все еще вынуждены занимать более низкий статус из-за сотрудников закона, которым было приказано защищать их. Кроме того, были заявления о том, что некоторые дискриминационные, супрематические организации проникли во многие муниципальные полицейские управления. После стольких сообщений из стольких источников я считаю, что необходимо немедленно принять меры для исправления этой проблемы. Таким образом, наша администрация будет продвигаться к кадровым перестановкам в полиции, санкционировать более жесткие проверки и меры проверки для новых сотрудников, а также разорвать связи между многими правоохранительными органами и сторонними элементами, такими как Ку-Клукс-Клан».\n\nЭтот шаг уже вызвал критику со стороны Юга, особенно со стороны губернатора Алабамы Джорджа Уоллеса, который назвал президента Джонсона "тираном" за "нарушение прав штатов на соблюдение своих собственных законов". Похоже, что многие политики ультраправого крыла Национал-Прогрессивной партии пытаются блокировать любые законы, которые администрация Джонсона может ввести для регулирования муниципальной полиции.

Один конкретный случай, когда владелец отеля в Джорджии был арестован за то, что позволил белой мафии ворваться в номер чернокожего человека, связать его, разбить его вещи и угрожать линчеванием, стал центром этой оппозиции, когда фракция Йоки НПП осудила ФБР, утверждая, что это превышение их полномочий, когда суды штата могли бы справиться с этим (и, несомненно, позволить белому владельцу отеля и мафии выйти на свободу).

Я просто хотел встретиться с Рокфеллером, присоединишься ко мне?»\n\nБарнетт, казалось, был не в лучшем настроении. «Нет, господин президент», - коротко ответил он, «я просто пришел сказать, что разочарован вашими законопроектами о гражданских правах».\n\n«Но ведь вы голосовали за них, да?»\n\n«Да, но они вышли далеко за рамки того, о чем мы договорились. Вы играли слишком быстро и слишком свободно с лояльностью демократов. В следующий раз мы вряд ли будем за вас».\n\nДжонсон улыбнулся, сделал шаг вперед и положил руку на плечо Барнетта. «Конгрессмен... Я делал только то, что считал морально правильным и лучшим для страны. Мы все одна партия, не так ли? А теперь позвольте мне сказать вам кое-что», - сказал он, и его улыбка стала кислой, «если вы когда-нибудь снова будете угрожать целостности Республиканско-Демократической партии, я поставлю вашу карьеру под угрозу.

Некоторые люди могли бы подумать, что управлять мясной лавкой плохая карьера, но Бо построил эту лавку голыми руками и был чрезвычайно горд. Он отпер дверь, вошел внутрь и принялся рубить свежую свинью, которую получил вчера.\n\nВскоре после того, как он разделил свинью на составные части, в дверь вошел человек в костюме, сопровождаемый местным шерифом Джеймсом Грином. Мужчина в костюме представился Дэвидом Смитом, адвокатом из Министерства здравоохранения, образования и социального обеспечения. Судя по акценту янки, федерал явно был нездешним. «Мистер Бо Олбрайт», - начал он, «я здесь, чтобы сообщить вам, что ваш бизнес нарушает новые федеральные законы о гражданских правах. Вы должны убрать свой знак "только для белых"».\n\nБо стоял, словно не понимая. Он посмотрел на шерифа Грина, который пожал плечами. «Я построил это место своими собственными руками», - сказал он, «разве я не имею права выбирать, кого пускать в свой магазин? Эти ниггеры - грязный народ; если я начну их впускать, то потеряю всех своих клиентов».\n\n«Если вы не начнете их впускать», - сказал янки, «у меня есть право возбудить против вас судебный иск, который может привести к конфискации вашей собственности. Снимите свой знак».\n\nС этими словами янки повернулся на каблуках и вышел из маленькой унылой мясной лавки. Бо посмотрел на шерифа Грина. «Вы не можете позволить этому сукиному сыну так поступить со мной», - сказал он, «это нарушение моих прав!»\n\nШериф Грин вздохнул: «Если вы действительно сердитесь, позвоните в офис губернатора.

 LBJ.60.desc:0 "Lyndon Baines Johnson sat in the Oval Office, the rare pleasure of pure, unabashed silence consuming the room. Paper after paper, meeting after meeting: the day had been a long one, and the Sun was just now caressing the western horizon. Suddenly, the door creaked open, and through it entered Vice President Edmund Muskie; the two proposals for a new immigration bill had been finally finished. "Democrat written," said Muskie, placing the one down in front of Johnson. "Republican written," he said, placing the other.\n\nJohnson exchanged no words with Muskie; he simply sat, scanning his eyes through the Democrat written immigration bill. It was very long, very thorough, and very restrictive. Immigration quotas would be increased, but upheld; travel to the United States from Germany and Japan would remain heavily restricted; and it would only slightly lessen requirements on applying for a visa. In short, it was extremely conservative, as he expected it to be. Technically, it wasn't even totally written by Democrats- the Republicans had a part in writing it as well- but the Dems always did have a tendency to drown out others.\n\nNext, Johnson flipped through the Republican proposal. At this point, it was just a rough draft- still subject to significant future revision- but the groundwork and basic contents were there. Johnson found it to be much more amiable to his plans than the previous one. If implemented, the bill would remove immigration quotas entirely; open up travel to and from Germany, Japan, and other foreign powers; and generally lessen restrictions on entering the United States, which have been very strict since the end of the Second World War.\n\n"Which one are we gonna move forward with?" asked Edmund Muskie. "If we go ahead with the Democrat proposal, we'll probably garner some more votes with it, so it's more assured. Our proposal, on the other hand, is much more in-line with our policies and campaign promises, but it'll be harder to push through Congress and the Democrats will consider it a slap in the face.""

The large vessel passed by Ellis Island, a mighty woman with a torch watching over the bay: Lady Liberty. This was everything Hans had ever hoped for and more. As Germany had fallen to pieces around him, he fled from his university dormitory to Denmark, and then to Scotland. For more than a year he had bided his time in Scotland, struggling to learn English, drifting from job to job, and desperately seeking an entry visa into the United States.\n\nHans' wish finally came true with President Lyndon Johnson's new immigration bill, which, after decades of hostility, allowed German nationals to enter the United States. Of course, one still had to obtain a visa, but no longer was travel to America limited to the rich or the powerful in Germany; now, even poor little Hans could pop onto a ship to a new world for a new life.\n\nThe barge was reeled into port on the north side of Manhattan. Walking down the plank onto the concrete dock, the Hudson River at his back, and the wind in his hair, he had finally arrived. America! The stench of ocean salt and garbage and industrial pollutants dominated the air, but Hans could care less. It was less the smell of refuse and more the taste of liberty.\n\n"Hey, you!"\n\nHans turned around to see a greasy-looking dock worker with jet black hair and a distinct accent talking to him. "Ya just gonna stand there or can we gets to work unloadin' this boat?"\n\n"I'm sorry," replied Hans in his thickly-accented English, "I just arrived from... Sweden. My name is John."\n\nThe man looked over him, a pensive look in his eye. "Well, John the Swede, I'll need a few more hands on the docks soon. How'd youse like a job workin' for me?"\n\nHans looked out over the massive hive of humanity called Manhattan. So much was different and new and breathtaking: the Empire State Building; jet planes flying far overhead; the hustle and bustle of the living, breathing city of New York. He had finally made it."

While his allies in Congress craft the bill itself and marshal congressional support to ensure its easy passage, the president himself has elected to meet with the most powerful teachers' unions in the country to ensure their support for his newest initiatives.\n\nOne of the most notable demands with the unions is to relax federal control over the methods by which teachers may engage with students and teach coursework in the classroom. There has already been some strong opposition to such a proposal, as it may allow "dissident" and "un-American" ideas to proliferate among young children and teenagers in our schools. Furthermore, promising such a reform may weaken our support among conservative Democrats and the staunchest anti-communists and -fascists. Others, however, posit that it may be a new radical step in allowing personalization of education, tailored toward the individual needs of students, and may overall improve the quality of education of our young people."

The president's supporters, as well as northern liberals, have urged Johnson to push forward in his program, criticism be damned.\n\nThus, determined as ever, President Johnson has continued to forge ahead on his legislative agenda.

Lessening the strain on the federal budget can allow for improved budgets for the Department of Defense, or simply stave off any risk of budgetary default in the future.\n\nThe president's allies in the Congress believe it is wholly likely for the bill to pass even with a stronger financial commitment to primary and secondary education. The question is whether the president wishes to further strain his relations with the powerful conservative lobby within his party\n\nFor Johnson's part, he would sooner scatter the most virulent opponents to his agenda to the four winds.

I have not met with every member of the Congress, held meetings with twenty teachers' unions across the entire country, crafting this bill to perfection -- just to be told 'no' by a few bigots voting for a party to which I owe no allegiance!"

He had been reading and editing and re-reading for hours now -- he wasn't quite sure how long. This draft was what he had asked for, all right -- and it was going to be a damned nightmare to push through the Congress.\n\nAfter the rigmarole the conservatives threw the president through over the writing and passage of ESEA, it is indeed very likely that HEA will receive sharp criticism from budget hawks in the Congress. Furthermore, directly aiding many colleges could possibly be viewed as favoritism. With party relations such as they are, committing to the funding plank could very well cause irreparable damage. If such damage were significant enough, the president's own chances at re-election could be jeopardized. However, Johnson's staunchest allies and supporters insist he commit to the university aid program on principle, arguing that the electoral drawback from doing so would be minimal at worst, and nonexistent at best.\n\nJohnson drew his red pen and marked out a line on the paper. "No, this won't do," he muttered to himself, scribbling a correction in the margin.\n\nThen again, not everyone could be pleased, and an effort in trying to please everyone was an effort wasted."

Aside from the extremists basing their arguments on racial logic, most opposition to HEA is organizing around rhetoric arguing for financial considerations. The educational debates being as fierce as they have been, it could ultimately be best to avoid such a commitment, and to move on to the next item on the Great Society agenda."

 LBJ.94.desc:0 "After days and weeks of intensive negotiations over the proposed Social Security Act, enough Democratic lawmakers have been convinced to support a "Compromise draft" for the rest to fall in line. This piece of legislation, while broadly similar to the unmodified bill, contains changes that narrow its scope somewhat. Payments have been reduced across all programs, provisions put in to make sure information about the programs reaches all eligible citizens have been gutted, and the clauses on Family Assistance have been rewritten to apply only to married couples. Many in the administration believe the "Compromise draft" as written amounts to an exclusion of some of the people in most dire need of assistance. Still, its passage has the potential to be a major victory for President Johnson and his choice to emphasize party unity on the matter.\n\nThere is, however, another price to be paid. A source of great consternation among the Democratic wing must be removed. The President must sever his alliance with "Scoop" Jackson and the NPP-C. The administrations have sent out feelers for possible alternative compromises, but all their suggestions have been rejected. The Democrats have made up their minds, and no amount of further negotiation, backroom dealing, appeals to party unity or outright bullying tactics will change them.\n\nThe president has a choice to make."

Jackson had staked a lot of prestige on their association, which had been considered a major victory within the party, proof of their ability to influence policy making on the highest level.\n\nThe NPP-C leadership had hoped they would now act as a counterweight to the conservative wing of the R-Ds, and that they could leverage that position to make policy gains. The passage of a substantial Social Security Act would be a crowning achievement, ushering a new era for the country and securing the NPP-C a seat at the table for the foreseeable future. When the President chose instead to cave to the demands of that very same conservative wing and end his association with Jackson, and then to pass a watered down bill, it felt to many in the party like they were relegated, again, to the sidelines.\n\nJackson's disappointment was plain to all when he publicly decried the Compromise Bill as "a victim, in my opinion, of putting party before country", which "denies support and opportunity to those Americans most in need of it". This gloominess does not extend, however, to the Far Right faction, whose lawmakers have made their approval of the revisions in the bill no secret. Their celebratory mood is beginning to give rise to considerable resentment in the rest of the party, once again calling into question the viability of an alliance between such a strange set of bedfellows."

Great effort has been expended in recruiting every supporter of the Act in pressuring, badgering and bullying its detractors into submission. Most of the Democratic lawmakers have fallen in line, seemingly judging that they still have too much to lose if they publicly speak out against their party.\n\nFor many Democratic voters, however, this is taken as another instance of the Republican wing happily taking their votes while ignoring their interests, feeding a growing sense of disenfranchisement with the party. Also feeding that sense are the firebrands of the NPP Far Right, who are finding a waiting audience for their condemnations of "the Socialist-in-Chief" and his "attacks on the white working man of America"."

Henry "Scoop" Jackson has hailed the bill as a "triumph of bipartisan cooperation" and "a great victory for the people of the United States".\n\nWithin the RD. It is very clear now that President Johnson's progressives are in the ascendancy, with conversations and planning focusing almost exclusively on how to build on their recent victory and little energy being spent on soothing ruffled feathers or bringing the Democratic wing back into the conversation. Among Democratic senators, a sense of unease is growing as they find the centre of gravity in the party moving further and further away from them, with little opportunity to correct its course lest they be cut off from decision-making entirely.

But as our efforts bear fruit in Congress, there are already rumbles of opposition building. Some conservatives in the Democratic wing of the party, as well as the FR-NPP, are starting to complain in private, and there are anonymous op-eds in newspapers all over the nation denouncing the efforts.\n\nThere is really nothing to be worried about now: most of these people would never have voted for the Great Society anyway if it wasn't political suicide to support the first acts that are generally popular with the American people. The few that did vote against these acts did so on grounds of high cost, and the encroachment into the state's prerogatives, and not necessarily in regard to the ideas themselves.\n\nIn general, our plans are moving ahead, and still have wide support, so we should be able to continue pushing forward to make America a better, more equal nation."

One Senator even said that we've done enough for this decade, and should let the next generation get a chance to do some stuff!\n\nWhile no one is breaking away and refusing to go along, we will most likely start seeing more resistance from the Democrats, and even some of the moderate Republicans, who believe that the Great Society has gone far enough.

Some Democrats voted against the last bill, some of those conservatives that like "small government" and "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps" and all that. While it wasn't enough to threaten the passing of these laws, it does mean that future laws will most likely require that we work with the Center faction of the National Progressive Party to ensure that we have enough support to pass through an increasingly divided Congress.\n\nYou should know as well as I do that this could be a problem: the Republican-Democrats were formed to keep the peace and stability of America first and foremost.

Fears that have been stoked by the Democrats and the NPP-FR about higher taxes and more government control of their lives are starting to filter through the public. While the numbers of people who support the Great Society overall are still strong, we should be prepared to face growing backlash as we expand it.\n\nThere are commentators and political scientists that are talking increasingly of the new polarization of American society, all revolving around your plans, with progressives on the left pushing to go even further than the Administration wants, and conservatives on the right who are demanding a halt to the growth of government power and interference in the lives of citizens and undermining states rights, and people in the middle who are tired of both extremes.\n\nThis is especially evident on the West Coast: while a majority were supportive of the Great Society at the beginning, now support is dropping, and dropping a lot quicker than in other places, namely about the cost. This is only going to get stronger, divide more Americans, and lead to a virtual breakdown of society into an "us vs. them" mentality that will make it even harder to pass further laws."

As the Republicans who are left in the R-D lean more progressive, we are actually lining up with the NPP-C on many social and economic issues, which should help make the Great Society legislation easier to pass and promote.\n\nOf course, there are going to be issues with working with the NPP-C: they are much more established leftists and progressives than most Republicans, so the future proposals will lean even more toward them, and bolster their own support in future elections. There are even some Democrats calling you the first NPP President as we continue to work with them.\n\nPolitics has always made for strange bedfellows, and working with some of the folks on the other side of the aisle is, well, strange and discomforting at times. But at least working with Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson is a lot easier, more pleasant, and less migraine inducing than with Barry Goldwater or Wallace Bennett.

It contains changes to almost every system of tariffs, levies or taxes collected by the federal government, and the increase in revenue will leave us a lot of extra funding even after Social Security is provided for.

You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You're really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God's children to have the basic necessities of life, she too will go to hell."\n\nPresident Johnson was guarded in his response, saying that he was committed to fighting the War on Poverty as a key plank of his Great Society program. The President thanked MLK for all his support and the meeting concluded cordially."
 LBJ.134.a:0 "How great can the Great Society become?"

 LBJ.135.t:0 "Черные голоса"
 LBJ.135.desc:0 "Республиканцы-демократы совершили один из самых монументальных подвигов в социальной истории Америки, приняв закон об избирательных правах. Чернокожие не только беспрепятственно идут на выборы, но и активно стекаются на избирательные участки, значительно увеличивая явку избирателей. Всплеск голосов распространяется по всему Югу, не только в крупных городах Бирмингема, Атланты или Хьюстона, но и в небольших городах Литл-Рок, Джексонвилл, Билокси. Население набирало силу даже в бедных сельских районах Центральной Алабамы и на окраинах огромных городов Джорджии.\n\nНо Линдон Б. Джонсон сегодня был очень занят. Было неизбежно, что при надлежащем представительстве чернокожие пойдут на выборы в огромных количествах, чтобы показать поддержку выбранной ими партии. Если бы Джонсону удалось набрать их голоса, вполне возможно, что РД-П могла бы стать доминирующей партией на Юге, вытеснив угрозу НПП. Это голосование компенсировало бы все Диксикраты, которые быстро покинули партию, как только закон был принят. Для президента Джонсона было важно время, когда он начал набирать активистов, церковных лидеров, профессоров по всему глубокому Югу, начиная с Алабамы, Арканзаса, Флориды, Джорджии..."
 LBJ.135.a:0 "Нам нужны негры на нашей стороне!"

 LBJ.136.t:0 "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.136.desc:0 ""Now, I know that things haven't been going our way since we were first brought to America centuries ago. We suffered under the lash for years and years, not just in the United States, but throughout the entire continent. It was by the will of Abraham Lincoln and by the grace of God that our chains were finally broken. We had some success in American culture; we had Frederick Douglass, we had George Washington Carver, we had Rosa Parks. These people worked to put us in the spotlight. My fellow African Americans, though we still face prejudice, our words now matter. Our vote finally matters. Our lives finally matter."\n\n"Do you know who made this happen? The Republican Party worked day and night to give us this opportunity. Our great President Johnson needs our help more than ever. He worked to give us the proper right to vote, he stopped every oppressive state that tried to lay a hand on us. I say we give back to him, to the Republican Party. If you haven't realized yet, my friends, we need them too. We will accept the President's Great Society with open arms."\n\nAfter several months of campaigning, the Republican Party started to win over some well-known activists to President Johnson's cause. These activists, in turn, reached out to the multitudes of African Americans in the South, persuading them to use their new vote for the party. While some progress has been made down South among the new black voters, there is still a long way to go before the Republicans could ever become relevant in the region."
 LBJ.136.a:0 "At least we're making progress."

 LBJ.137.t:0 "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.137.desc:0 ""Look how the world around us is changing with President Johnson at the helm. We've been given the incredible voting privilege that has eluded us countless times in the past. Our poorer blacks in the South are more likely to afford cheap housing thanks to President Johnson's housing act. The schools for our black children are being given more funds, and they are being recognized for their academic achievements. Our older blacks are receiving the care they so desperately need thanks to the new Medicare program. Folks, I see a lot of potential with the Republican Party after looking around at the Great Society we are living in. If we keep voting Republican, I believe all American lives will get better and better."\n\nOur campaigning is proving to be very successful at gaining the African American vote in the South. The more activists we influence, the more momentum we gather to topple the traditional parties that have dominated the South for decades. We have noted a substantial increase in popularity among blacks in poorer regions, which can only mean that our Great Society is working.\n\nOur campaign has shown some slight flaws: our hardcore traditional whites have started to denounce our platform, claiming that we are "ceding too much to the blacks", but this would come naturally with the addition of new party voters. The issue should not gather enough support to put a dent in our party, but it is something to monitor. Nevertheless, every black voter who once faced oppression at the booth now prepares to defend their newly-given vote with all they have. Our reforms are truly reaching out to all Americans."
 LBJ.137.a:0 "Even more support from the African American community."

 LBJ.138.t:0 "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.138.desc:0 ""Now we have a choice in this next election. We can go with the Republicans, who keep backing us up and will have our back until the end of time, or we can choose the radicals in the NPP who want to tear this country apart and go back to square one. Ultimately it's your choice. But I believe the Republican Party is the right choice to help our country move forward. And with your votes, my brothers and sisters, we will continue the changes that have brought many of us hope and prosperity."\n\nNew polls keep coming in from government agencies, and we are starting to see a rise in popularity the likes of which we have never seen before. It is very likely that with the African American vote, we can turn the South around completely. Even in states like Alabama and South Carolina, where the Republican votes were few and far between, we have started to gain tremendous ground thanks to the large African American populations in these states. However, it would be a lie to say that these states will totally support the Republicans in the next election; already, many Conservative white Americans are expressing their clear disapproval, and they are quickly ditching our party in favor of the dreaded alternative. Our wonderful activists will do more than make up the losses our party suffered, and with their help, we have already gained so many more African Americans to our side. If we keep pushing for change, we will have the entire South in our grasp in no time."
 LBJ.138.a:0 "Awesome"

 LBJ.139.t:0 "A Dream More Than Dreamt!"
 LBJ.139.desc:0 "We put so much effort into passing the reforms that led to President Johnson's "Great Society" and we are finally starting to reap the fruits of our labor. At the end of the day, our carefully-planned policies and our wonderful campaigns have given us a competitive voter base in even the most Conservative regions of the nation. We owe it all to the brave activists that preached our party to the masses of African Americans across the South. We owe it all to President Johnson's government who worked tirelessly to pass legislation that would benefit all Americans regardless of race.\n\nEven now, our work is far from over. Racism is still a widespread issue, and prejudice against Republicans continues as it has since the start of Reconstruction. More white voters have deserted the party during this campaign; in fact, we've lost almost every Dixiecrat member to the NPP. Even with the Republican unity among African Americans, division between blacks and whites is even more apparent.\n\nRegardless, President Johnson's Great Society has improved American healthcare, education, civil rights, and many other important parts of daily life. There is no doubt that the Republican Party will continue gaining lifetime supporters as a result of Lyndon Johnson's successes. Our activists, now working as full-fledged members of the Republican Party, will continue promoting the party that has already helped so many Americans through Johnson's plan."
 LBJ.139.a:0 "The future is bright for the revitalized Republicans."

 LBJ.140.t:0 "Price of Expedience"
 LBJ.140.desc:0 "The good faith among African Americans engendered by President Johnson's attempt to pass substantial housing access reform has been poisoned by his surrender on the issue. Republican's blatantly political reversal on the issue is a spit in the face to the constituency. The high minded rhetoric that preceded it just makes the betrayal sting all the more.\n\nCivil rights leaders are denouncing the president and his party in the strongest language, and editorials on the failure of the R-D's to address civil rights are flying. Pundits of all stripes are predicting the black vote moving towards the NPP. Progressives in that party are taking full advantage of the beating the Republicans are taking, proposing more aggressive national policies to combat discrimination in housing, employment, and education."
 LBJ.140.a:0 "There goes that bloc."

 LBJ.141.t:0 "Not a Hero"
 LBJ.141.desc:0 "President Johnson's weak Housing Act is making many Republican African Americans question their allegiances. It's hard to see more than squandered opportunity in the bill that was passed. It's becoming clear to many that Republicans won't sacrifice moderate white votes by strongly pursuing civil rights. President Johnson's credibility as an ally, established by his support for voting rights, has taken a nosedive.\n\nThese developments will hurt the RDs in the South, where black support for their candidates was crucial in holding back NPP-R challengers. It will take stronger efforts on behalf of their rights to repair the relationship with black voters.
 LBJ.141.a:0 "We'll weather this, somehow."

 POLITICS_GOV_DESC:0 "George Stanley McGovern is quite the accomplished man; veteran, doctor of history, and nearly 15 years in Congress are just a few of his more notable achievements. For all his intelligence and fame, however, he remains a modest man of the people. He speaks softly, wears less-than-extravagant clothing, and comes from a humble background of a South Dakota farming community.\n\nDuring his time in the Army Air Corps, flying bombers over German-occupied Europe, McGovern saw firsthand the destruction that the conflict wrought over the continent, and the suffering it brought. Thus, he swore "never again", retiring from the military after the war's conclusion in 1945, and earning a PhD in history from Northwestern University in 1953. Consistently, throughout his political career, McGovern has vehemently opposed any military intervention in foreign conflicts, even going so far as to suggest reconciliation with the Germans and Japanese. These suggestions have fallen upon deaf ears, until now.\n\nAs President of the United States of America, McGovern stands in a position to achieve what all of his predecessors have failed to: peace. Peace with the Germans and their dominions in Europe. Peace with the Japanese and their East Asian ventriloquist show. The end of the despised military-industrial complex that dragged the American people into the quagmires of South Africa and Indonesia. With McGovern as Commander-in-Chief, America is far more likely to save the world with flowers than it is to end it with force."

 USA.1702.t:0 "President McGovern's Inaugural Address"
 USA.1702.d:0 ""Friends, today is a momentous day in American history. Two centuries ago our nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom, but the beautiful, bold dream that our forefathers fought for has yet to reach its consummation. Today, rather than set forth a new dream, I wish to urge the old dream on. The dream that I, too, have cried out for all my political career. I cry for more than simple freedom to act, to speak, and to be happy; I cry for freedom from the conflict that we embroil ourselves in, time and time again. For the majority of our great country's history, we have been in conflict with nations both foreign and civil. Well, I say that no longer shall we fight. No longer shall we enslave ourselves to the sword. Going forward, our swords shall be hammered back into plowshares."\n\n"America, I ask you to look deep inside your hearts and truly realize the spiritual and emotional revolution this country is about to embark upon. No more saber-rattling with foreign powers, no more annual threats of annihilation. No America, I say unto you, that part of history is finished. Now comes the time for peace and reconciliation with those whom we have wronged, and those who have wronged us."\n\n"I have been given a great responsibility to shepherd our great nation into such an era, and it is not one that I accept lightly, nor is it a burden I can carry alone. It is my belief that this administration should incorporate the wisest and most peaceable of individuals, as well as those most modest, such that understanding between all may be achieved. I promise this, America, and more.""

POLITICS_GLN_DESC:0 "John Glenn's meteoric rise to the presidency came as a surprise to observers of the normally cautious and conservative Republican-Democrats. Only six years after his final trip to space and initial foray into politics, the new commander in chief faces a situation with more possibility than any president in recent memory. While Germany and Japan struggle to keep their empires afloat, Glenn is looking to the stars.\n\nTo nobody's surprise, the Glenn administration has chosen to prioritize spaceflight and the race to conquer the final frontier. The first man in space and the first astronaut to hold political office, Glenn invested heavily in aerospace companies during his time as Governor of Ohio, a trend which is likely to continue. With America's advances in missile and rocket technology, a trip to the moon is not out of reach. And once the moon is conquered, who knows where NASA could go next?\n\nBut Glenn did not just win political office because of his fame. A successful program of welfare reform as Governor of Ohio has gained him the support of both elderly and impoverished voters, and put to rest claims by his opponents that Glenn has his head in the stars.\n\nWhile Glenn will not neglect America in favor of the space program, those who know him privately can tell what his goals truly are. He only speaks about Köllner's moon landing with measured restraint, giving the public a dispassionate and clearly rehearsed line, but his first budgetary requests have made his intentions clear: Glenn's America will return to the stars. Failure is not an option."

USA_68_Glenn_Presidency_desc:0 "Under the bold new leadership of John Glenn, the R-Ds have recovered from their shocking defeat in 1964 and will lead America into a new age- an age of prosperity, equality, and above all, progress! While the celebrations are ending, we will need to appoint a cabinet and prepare ourselves for the long road ahead- to succeed in our objectives, we must advocate to the American people on behalf of the space program, and manage our resources carefully to ensure extraterrestrial superiority.\n\nOur laboratories and engineers are standing by, prepared to return America to its status as the most technologically advanced of the three superpowers. The Manned Spacecraft Center has already been given orders to resume operations, and soon Americans will return to space. Per aspera ad astra!"
USA_Glenn_Time_to_Clean_House_desc:0 "The NPP has been expelled from the executive branch by the will of the people, but their influence still remains. Their appointees are still dotting the administration like rats in the walls- and while their intentions may be good, their effect on our administration is not. Many of them are young activists who should never have been hired or old legacy employees who should have retired long ago.\n\nFirst things first, we get rid of everyone who isn't interested in following our goals- they simply have no place in our new vision for the United States. The radicals will be thrown out, and we will restore stability and rationality to our government once more. And then, we can begin enacting the president's plans..."
USA_Glenn_Appease_the_Party_desc:0 "Supporting the space program is all very well and good, but we have to be realistic about this process. Many of our supporters are skeptical of our plans for NASA, and no matter how many aerospace jobs we can put in their states, there's no getting around the fact that we're going to be spending a lot of money. With the C-NPP advocating expansive social programs, the FR-NPP demanding we increase the defense budget, and the Democrats in our own party suggesting that maybe we should just spend less, we'll have to fight tooth and nail to give the program the funding it needs. We should start things off on the right foot by giving our allies the people they want in the positions they want. It might not be ideal, but giving out a few favors will let us get a lot more in return in the future, and keep the Democrats quiet for now."
USA_Glenn_Bring_in_the_Technocrats_desc:0 "We're bringing in the best that we can. Scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and all sorts of experts. Who cares that they have no political connections? Cronyism and corruption is how we got Nixon and nearly broke the party. Congress may complain, but we can appease them easily enough, and this will ultimately lead to a stronger support staff in the future. It's more important that the officials we hire know how to do their jobs than it is that they know their local Congressman. We're already fighting for second in the moon race, and we cannot rise to meet the challenge on the backs of political appointees."
USA_Glenn_Crossing_The_New_Frontier_desc:0 "America is a nation founded by explorers and pioneers, and a nation that has lost its way amidst the troubled times. To defeat the evils of fascism, we must show the world that democracy is the way of the future- a stable bedrock upon which mankind will make its way to the stars.\n\nOur journey will not be an easy one, but such is the nature of exploration. Columbus was met with nothing but doubters until the Spanish gave him the resources he needed- and he was a novice sailor. We are assailed with many skeptics as well, but we have the brainpower and resources of the greatest country in the world at our disposal. President Glenn shall lead our nation, and our species, into a brave new world."
USA_Glenn_Dream_Never_Died_desc:0 "NASA these days is a sad shell of what it used to be during the glorious days where we won the race into orbit. Funding has all but dried up, and the majority of its facilities are already decrepit after years of neglect. The German victory broke America's will to continue the space race, but not NASA. The few employees left from the early days still believe in its founding vision, and are ready to do the hard work of bringing NASA back to its full capability.\n\nWe have not forgotten how the Nazis sullied the lunar landscape with the swastika in 1962, and we will not forget our unfinished business on the moon. It's time to catch up in the race for the stars."
USA_Glenn_Pathway_to_the_Sky_desc:0 "The greatest hurdle to reaching space is not gaining altitude, it is attaining the speed necessary to maintain those altitudes, and reaching higher orbits- such as that of the moon- require even higher speeds, or increased quantities of propellant. Whichever approach we decide on, we will need to continue our development of rockets technology to get back on parity with the other superpowers. The capsule is critical to keep the astronauts alive, the avionics are necessary to direct the rocket, but the propulsion system is the most important part of the rocket to get it anywhere. We require an incredible amount of power to reach orbit, and to go further we must continue to refine our approach."
USA_Glenn_Stick_What_Worked_desc:0 "To further our endeavours in space, we must take every step to ensure the safety of our brave astronauts. Our Explorer program allowed us to make major advances in the field of unmanned exploration. Operating unmanned probes in orbit gives us insight into remote operations and controlling vehicles outside of the atmosphere, and allows us to test new and unproven launch systems without risking the lives of NASA personnel. It's time to bring back the Explorer program and take our first step into the great unknown."
USA_Glenn_Smaller_Payloads_desc:0 "In the cold vacuum of space, there is no room for error. The calculations to operate spacecraft need to be computed rapidly and accurately. Even the slightest mistake could mean the loss of an expensive rocket, or worse, the death of a mission crew.\n\nFortunately, our best mathematicians are developing innovative new computers to control our unmanned probes, which will both improve our capacity to gather scientific data, and the safety of our manned missions. Every possible error must be stamped out and eliminated to make our program as safe as it can be."
USA_Glenn_The_Boosters_desc:0 "As our rocketry program continues to develop, we must consider one of the most important questions to further our development. Which type of propulsion do we focus our efforts on? The tried and true solid fuel? Or the new and exciting possibilities opened up by liquid fuel?"
USA_Glenn_In_With_New_desc:0 "Our computers are capable of calculations at speeds that would have been impossible a few decades ago, but they suffer from one fundamental flaw; they are only as good as the people operating them. The same goes for our spacecraft, intricate machines that require an advanced understanding of their operations. Every member of NASA must be intimately familiar with their role in the team, and prepared to do their job, from Director Webb to the astronauts manning our spacecraft to the support staff at ground control. Machines serve our purposes well, but they will only reach other worlds under the guidance of men."
USA_Bigger_Is_Better_desc:0 "No American has been in space since 1962, when the space program had its funding slashed over the protests of our current president. Our unmanned program has made great strides towards our ultimate goals, but to prove ourselves to the American people and humanity, we must return to orbit.\n\nProject Daedalus will put a man in orbit for the first time since Eberhard Köllner's moon landing in January 1962, further our study of space travel and its effects on the human body, and show the world that the United States of America has returned to the race across the final frontier."
USA_Glenn_Solid_Fuel_desc:0 "Spaceflight is complicated; the more points of potential failure we introduce, the more likely it is that failure will occur. Solid fuel rockets offer the advantage of being dependable and, well, solid. Primitive solid fuel rockets have been used since medieval times for the purposes of warfare, but under President Glenn we will turn them into an instrument of exploration. These time-tested rockets offer a high level of reliability and simplicity- and when you're sitting on top of a giant fuel container, travelling at hundreds of miles per hour, you want all the reliability you can get."
USA_Glenn_Liquid_Fuel_desc:0 "Liquid fuel rockets are an all-American invention- they may have been co-opted by the Nazis for the V2 program, but they were invented by an American, Dr. Robert Goddard, two decades before anyone cared about the name von Braun!\n\nPatriotic sentiments aside, the Germans used them with good reason- liquid fuel is far more efficient than solid due to the compressibility of liquids and a significantly lighter rocket. We will beat the fascists at their own game and rise to the stars on a stream of burning liquid propellant!"
USA_Dust_Off_Plans_desc:0 "The reluctance of politicians to invest in the future of humanity is appalling. Rather than spend money for potential gains in the future, most would rather take the safe bet and remain at a standstill. Our president knows the value of scientific progress, however, and is willing to make bold and daring strides into the unknown- and back it up with a budget to match.\n\nOur old facilities still have old plans and proposals for various projects- including our own moon landing and other ambitious projects. Let's turn our engineers loose and see what they can come up with."
USA_Saturn_V_desc:0 "Our best scientists and engineers have come back with an old plan, to which they've made significant modifications. This mighty rocket is the largest one we have ever constructed, and carries a hefty price tag to match. The Saturn I-IV rockets were originally designed just before the end of the US space program in an effort to prepare for our own moonshot, and now our new design will carry Americans to the moon and beyond. There are still further modifications to be made before putting it into production, but the work of the old NASA has made our journey much easier."
USA_New_NASA_desc:0 "NASA has been left adrift and rudderless for years, thanks to the shortsighted views of previous administrations since we "lost" the space race, cutting funding and pushing manpower to other areas. But that was just the first battle, not the whole war. There is so much to discover among the stars, so much to explore, that we shouldn't be confining ourselves to being simply second best. With massive new funding, we can rebuild the space program, and push past all the boundaries! It's time to go where no man has gone before!"
USA_Siphon_Funding_desc:0 "The Pentagon budget is massive: it's the single largest line item in federal expenditures. Now, while most of it goes to things like paying our soldiers and maintaining our tanks, ships and planes, there is always a bit here and there that isn't actually going to keep America safe right now. Pet projects, bloated defense contracts, and theoretical programs that are years, if not decades away from fruition. If we divert some funding from these programs to NASA, we can get to space much faster. And if a few guys in uniforms with too many stars on their shoulders and not enough imagination in their brains start yelling, well so be it."
USA_Best_Brightest_desc:0 "There was a time when applications to join NASA outnumbered the available jobs by a factor of five to one, and the best and brightest of America would excitedly jump to joining the space program. Now, it's hard to fill all the positions, as there is more money and prestige in the private sector for boring jobs like financial analysts and designing cars. If we are getting back into the Space Race, then we need to get them back. Better wages is just part of the plan: we need to make it so that people willingly come, to bring new ideas, new perspectives. They need to know that they are going to make our world a better place by exploring the cosmos. "
USA_Upgrade_Testing_Range_desc:0 "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the crown jewel of the American space program. However, with budget cuts and manpower shortages in the past few years, the facility has fallen into a state of disorganization and demoralization. But that's nothing that a few million dollars, some brand new room sized computers and a coat of paint can't fix. Soon the contagious dreams of youngsters wanting to build the spaceships of the future to explore the solar system, to see if the truth is out there..."
USA_Money_Never_Stops_desc:0 "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now back on its feet, and proposing some big plans: probes to explore all the other planets in the solar system, rovers for Mars, a gleaming new space station in orbit around the planet, reusable space shuttles, and even a base on the moon, all powered by bigger and more powerful rockets. It will be expensive, in the tens of billions of dollars. But that is a small price to pay to further our knowledge of space, the universe, and our place in it, and to beat the Germans in every possible manner. They may have landed on the Moon first, but America will go to infinity and beyond!"
USA_Surviving_The_Cosmos_desc:0 "	Many times has the United States of America ventured beyond the grasp of her planet's soil, and many times has it been successful. However, our most recent plans to travel, not just beyond our world, but to grace others, are far more daunting and difficult challenges than the American space program has ever faced. Having never launched Astronauts beyond low Earth orbit, we are ill-prepared for the dangers and difficulties in keeping them alive in space for more than a few days. Before we can begin the true work of getting to both the Moon and Mars, we must first surmount the challenge of ensuring that our brave solar sailors are alive when they actually reach their heavenly destinations."
USA_Board_Diagnostics_desc:0 "	To be chosen as an astronaut candidate is to be one of an extremely select number of individuals, and to actually become an astronaut is an even rarer honor. In short, it requires an extraordinary amount of talent, followed by an equally extraordinary amount of training. As time has gone on, astronaut selection has gone down, and the training has become inadequate for the realities of modern spaceflight. To rectify this issue, we must implement new training regimens for astronaut candidates to ensure they are up to speed with current realities of NASA. In addition, we will begin pulling some of the most exemplary pilots that the United States military has to offer as candidates for the next class of NASA astronauts."
USA_Rework_Capsule_desc:0 "	This new era of American space travel faces hazards and challenges never before anticipated or planned for by our engineers. Most of our current crew capsules were designed in the late fifties or early sixties and, as such, are woefully under equipped to handle the dangers in traveling beyond low Earth orbit. For example, most of our crew modules lack a docking port, meaning that, should it be used in the Apollo Program, our astronauts traveling to the Moon would have to land with all of their fuel in tow, forcing them to expend much more rocket propellant when returning back to Earth. In addition, none of our current capsules have a carrying capacity for more than 2 individuals, with almost no cargo space: an unacceptable shortcoming for a Lunar lander.\n\nTo rectify these problems, a new, more modern crew capsule must be designed. This capsule would be far more spacious than previous iterations, with a capacity for 3 or possibly 4 astronauts. In addition, it would contain small, but serviceable living quarters, as missions to the Moon and other places beyond low Earth orbit will take days to weeks. Overall, while designing and constructing this new capsule may prove expensive, it may be the most vitally important part of getting to the Moon."
USA_Pinpoint_Thrusters_desc:0 "The current plan for the Apollo Moon landing is to have the main crew module remain in lunar orbit with a single crewman remaining aboard, while a specialized lander with the other two crewmen travels down to the surface. After concluding surface activities, the lander will return to orbit to dock with the crew module. If NASA is to go through with this idea, both our lander and crew module will require more advanced reaction control systems (RCS), or pinpoint thrusters, colloquially.\n\nPreviously, the pinpoint thrusters of American spacecraft could basically only control rotational motion and minor attitude adjustment. Should our current plan for the Apollo Program come to fruition, the ability to dock two spacecraft- something rarely performed by NASA in the past- will become a necessity. As such, the newly designed Apollo crew capsule and lander will require more advanced and precise reaction control systems that can control not only perform course adjustment and rotation, but close maneuvering and minor thrust."
USA_Rework_Suit_desc:0 "	The current American space suit designs are meant for short excursions in the zero-g environs of low Earth Orbit and, as such, are simply not equipped to handle long trips in space, and especially not walking on the moon. If we not only want to send a man to the moon, but allow him to land there, two new space suit designs must be commissioned. Firstly, we simply need a more modern, streamlined, general-purpose space suit: something that our astronauts will wear while in space. It will need to be relatively light, flexible, and unobtrusive, able to survive in low pressures and moderate conditions.\n\nThe other variety of suit is a more difficult engineering challenge. It will be our extravehicular suit, expected to perform everything from short spacewalks for basic repairs, to extreme lunar excursions lasting several hours. It must not be too heavy, nor too bulky, as our astronauts must perform basic tasks, like walking, and sensitive tasks, like manipulating specialized tools. This extravehicular suit will be one of the cornerstones upon which the future of American space exploration is built; without it, we are going nowhere."
USA_Improve_Insulation_desc:0 "The boundless vacuum of space is a place of extremes, seldom more true than in temperature. Without an atmosphere, there is no protective shield against temperature changes, so the temperatures a spacecraft experiences can range from a scalding 200 degrees Fahrenheit in the sunlight to 300 degrees below zero in the shade. While in previous years our astronauts would simply wear heavy pressure suits while in space, our future forays into the heavens will require a new solution. Astronauts simply cannot be expected to wear such bulky equipment for days or weeks on end. To counteract this problem, our crew modules will have to be equipped with the best insulation available, such that they may survive both the icy and scalding regions of the void."
USA_Glenn_The_Great_Unknown_desc:0 "	Who knows what lies beyond the miniscule coil of Earth's influence? Who knows what dangers lie in above the sky, in the great boundless void that surrounds all? Who knows what dangers we may encounter when we enter that void? If the American space program is to be prepared for a landing on the Moon and, eventually, Mars, we must harden our system against damage. We must prepare for every eventuality, from communications failures to solar flares to radiation to cabin fires. All of these potential problems, and more, must be planned for. There must be a backup for every possible system, and a protocol for every possible disaster."
USA_Glenn_Improved_Fuel_Lines_desc:0 "	A fuel tank is a rather simple thing; perhaps the most simple component of any space-bound vessel. Obviously, without fuel, a rocket will not fly, and to reach the Moon and Mars, our rockets will need an extraordinary amount of it. As such, it becomes necessary to take a step back and reexamine our fuel tank design, tweaking certain elements to create the most optimal design possible. Certain features, such as advanced alloys for more robust construction, as well as more sheathing and insulation for electrical components, will allow our rockets to be much safer. Most important however, is weight, for when the cost of launching a pound of payload into orbit may be in excess of a thousand dollars, it must be considered. To ensure that we can launch more, for less, investigating lighter materials from which to construct our fuel tanks may prove worthwhile."
USA_Glenn_Upgraded_Radio_desc:0 "	No great achievement of humanity was done in silence. All of Mankind's creations, from the Great Pyramids of Giza; to the Great Wall of China; to the torch of the New Colossus that beckons the huddled masses into liberty, are a consequence of our unique ability of communication. A lunar landing is easily on-par with such spectacular monuments of our species, and thus is no different in terms of needing communication, most especially regarding contact while the mission is in progress. To ensure that we remain connected with our astronauts during our next forays into the stars, we will upgrade the majority of our Earthbound transmitters, as well as develop new comm systems for our crew capsules. Without the help of ground control, they will get nowhere; after all, from highest heaven to deepest nether, they travel farthest who travel together."
USA_upgrading_the_infrastructure_desc:0 "We have accomplished more for spaceflight than most nations ever will, but we can not lose our momentum now. It's time to fly even higher, and to do that we need to improve the infrastructure that supports NASA. Larger runways will support specialized aircraft that can safely transport critical rocket parts, and improved research facilities allow us to test larger rocket engines, fabricate parts with even more precision, and overcome the engineering challenges that have shackled us to Earth for so long."
USA_Human_Stress_test_desc:0 "Being in space is, understandably, harsh upon the human body, with the effects of zero g-force and high amounts of radiation- not to mention the horrific sense of isolation- wearing down on astronauts. Getting there can be even more stressful, as the extremely high g-forces during launch and reentry have the potential to scrap entire missions by knocking astronauts unconscious. In order to counteract these potential effects, we can harden our cadets by including high g-force centrifuge training, isolation chambers, and simulation zero-g exercises into their training regimen."
USA_Ready_For_Anything_desc:0 "Thanks to our initiative, the United States of America and her space program are as prepared as can be for the dangers of venturing far out into the great void. With the finalization of these great advancements in technology, spacecraft design, and procedure, it seems as though no astral disaster can prove too challenging, or any distance too great, to overcome. America, her astronauts, and her space program are aware of the great difficulties that lie ahead, but now they need not fear. Houston may be assured: there will be no problems."
USA_Stars_Beckon_desc:0 "We have persisted through budget cuts, doubting Congressmen, and the humiliation of the Nazi moon landing to retake our spot as the leading nation in the exploration of space. NASA's efforts have met with success after success, and we must ride this wave of momentum even farther afield while enthusiasm is still high. The administration is abuzz with an energy not seen in years, and a sense that we are on our way to greatness, as we reach out to touch the stars."
USA_Lessons_of_Gemini_desc:0 "The Gemini program was one of our greatest successes, giving us our first practical experience with manned spaceflight and the first taste of the stars for President Glenn. While this opportunity may have been squandered, the lessons of the program must not be forgotten if we wish to continue onwards and upward. On the back of the Gemini program, we have achieved greatness, and now we shall surpass those heights."
USA_Heartbreak_Apollo_desc:0 "The worst day of John Glenn's life was the day of the Germans landed on the moon. The pain and anguish that brought, the long days of sorrow and depression, gave him a resolve never to fall behind again in the race for glory among the stars. We cannot allow ourselves to be held back by past failures- instead we must learn the lessons of those failures and allow them to propel us forward."
USA_Project_Viking_desc:0 "Unmanned probes are not flashy, cannot think for themselves, and cannot be the face of the space program. However, they offer several other advantages, the main one being that we can test out our systems without having to unnecessarily risk the lives of our astronauts. We are planning the most ambitious exploration project in the history, and it would be foolish to embark on this great journey without making at least a few trial runs. Directing more funding to our probe division will allow us to develop the sort of data we need for the safest possible landing we can get."

USA_Project_Mariner_desc:0 "When our courageous explorers set off on the journey of a lifetime, they shall not go alone. The American people have been disaffected and demoralized for too long. President Glenn will address the nation, and make them know that their country needs them. Our heroes of science and progress will inspire the nation, and our population's spirits shall soar with our rockets to greater heights than ever before."
USA_Project_Ares_desc:0 "The time has come. The crowning achievement of the American space program and the pinnacle of human technological development, Project Ares, is ready for launch. Our crew travels with the prayers of every American, and the eyes of the entire world upon them. We have proven we could equal the heights of the German space program; now the American eagle must soar to far greater heights.\n\nOur technicians, engineers, and launch personnel have been preparing for this mission for their entire careers. The red planet lies within our grasp, and we cannot let it slip through our fingers. The flag of our nation standing tall on Mars, millions of miles from our home, shall reaffirm our status as the greatest country in the world!\n\nGodspeed, gentlemen. Start the countdown."
USA_Eagle_has_Landed_desc:0 "We have dared to attempt the impossible, and now, thanks to the tireless work by NASA and the Glenn administration, we have done it. For the first time in human history, a man has stepped upon the surface of another world, and returned safely to our soil. The nation has effectively shut down, with riotous celebrations held across the country and a ticker-tape parade held for the crew of Ares Four in New York City. Calls of congratulations have come from leaders across the world, including everyone from our allies in the OFN to the Prime Minister of Japan. The flight crew have described themselves as the happiest men on the planet, but the White House staff knows better. The happiest man in the world sits in the Oval Office, half-listening to the terse congratulations of the Fuhrer, basking in America's greatest triumph of the century."
USA_Glenn_Power_of_the_Atom_desc:0 "To solely focus on atomic power through the lens of the bombing of Pearl Harbor is to miss the forest for the trees. Nuclear energy, if harnessed correctly, could provide nearly limitless energy for millions of Americans still suffering from blackouts or interrupted deliveries of coal and oil. It is high time we redoubled our scientific efforts to harness the power of the atom, for both its peaceful and warlike applications, to succor our people and instill fear in our enemies."
USA_Glenn_We_shall_have_it_all_desc:0 "Nuclear technology is, by and large, dependent on a single natural resource: uranium. The means for securing domination over our rivals in nuclear technology must start from seizing any and all natural deposits of this mineral, or buying out all of our rivals. And what we cannot have, we must ensure that our enemies cannot make use of either."
USA_Glenn_Corner_The_Market_desc:0 "Forcing the rival superpowers out of the nuclear business can't simply be done by restricting access to uranium alone. The myriad machines and intermediate inputs necessary to build both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons are often commercially available, criss-crossing the world through the arteries of global trade on a daily basis. Cornering the market for these components will not only weaken our enemies, but serve to empower ourselves, if we can afford it."
USA_Glenn_Yeld_Must_Grow_desc:0 "Denial of the enemy is not enough to win the war. Our own advancement of the nuclear sciences must match, and overpace, that of Germany and Japan if we mean to conclusively overpower them in nuclear armaments. The development of ever-stronger nuclear weapons demands ever-larger investments in our scientific and industrial base - a price well worth paying."
USA_Glenn_New_Delivery_System_desc:0 "Having the industry to develop and produce nuclear weapons is only the start; we must continually invest in and refine our delivery systems. Accuracy, yield, and survivability are words to live by if we plan to win a nuclear war; thankfully, the Pentagon has proposed a new generation of missiles, the Eros system, that should deliver on all of these criteria."
USA_Glenn_Increase_Payload_desc:0 "The effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal depends on the retention of multiple means of delivering a salvo of atomic fire on our enemies - by land, by sea, and by air. Continued development of the three legs of the nuclear triad will be essential in convincing our enemies that they have no hope of winning a nuclear conflict of the United States, and that their best interests lie at the negotiating table on our terms."
USA_Glenn_Upgrade_the_Targeting_desc:0 "Circular error probable - the bane of any ballistics targeting exercise. While some would argue that accuracy is overrated when a weapon's explosive force is measured in megatons of TNT, accuracy will forever and always be a crucial indicator of a weapon system's maturity. The more missiles we can accurately deliver on target, the more confident we can end a conflict with a single stroke. The supercomputers of NASA, already used to calculate rocket trajectories, can easily be repurposed for the work of nuclear warfare."
USA_Glenn_Federal_Pilot_Reactors_desc:0 "Even if politicians and scientists are convinced of the benefits of nuclear power, America as a whole remains wary of the atomic project, with the bombing of Pearl Harbor seared into the public conscience. The process of winning the people over to the side of progress will take time and patience, as we demonstrate the safety and benefits of nuclear energy via a program of federally funded 'pilot reactors' in several cities across America."
USA_Glenn_Pay_for_Conversation_desc:0 "The benefits of nuclear power are immense, but so are the start-up costs. Not every state or local municipality in America will be able to shoulder the cost of ensuring a safe and stable power supply for all of its residents. Thankfully, the federal government can step in to fill the gap, both to ensure a steady demand for expertise in the nuclear field, and to win a few votes along the way... "
USA_Glenn_Recruit_Disney_desc:0 "As much as we've tried to boil down the science of nuclear power for the average citizen, there are bottlenecks. Most Americans don't read Scientific American, and many viewers yawn and change the channel when faced by an egghead on television. Selling a government project to the people has always been as much about familiar images and relatability as it has been about the actual facts at hand. And who - or what - is more familiar and relatable to the average American than Mickey Mouse?"
USA_Glenn_We_Control_The_Power_desc:0 "There are those who say that the value of a nuclear arsenal, of a nation's deterrent, starts and ends with its mere existence, by simply retaining the ability to vaporize the world a hundred times over with the press of a button. President Glenn disagrees; the atom is not like a god, terrible and vengeful. It is a tool - and a tool has many uses, if we only would employ it as such in our negotiations with Germany and Japan."
USA_Early_Warning_Station_Reykjavic_desc:0 "To boldly make nuclear force a centerpiece of American strategy requires that we protect ourselves against any German or Japanese attempt to disarm or disrupt our nuclear arsenal. Early warning and (where possible) surgical strikes must be the centerpiece of any such effort, and Iceland, the closest OFN territory to continental Europe, is ideally located to host the facilities needed to achieve this objective. We will draw up plans to base new over-the-horizon radars and hardened air bases in Iceland, the tip of the spear against the Unity Pakt and the German menace."
USA_Nuclear_Iceland_desc:0 "The Hawaiian Missile Crisis proved one thing, above all else: the immediate presence of a nuclear threat has the potential to bring any power to the negotiating table. If a nation perceives that there is a new threat in their backyard, they will seek to address it, preferably without triggering doomsday. And, fortunately, the United States has just the place for such a threat to be established: Iceland.\n\nAcross the archipelago of bases that make up US Forces Iceland, we already have a large number of nuclear-capable B-58s and B-52s ready to go at a moment's notice, of course. But by constructing new missile silos for our MRBMS and ICBMs, a signal would be sent. Planes and crews may come and go, but silos are permanent. It would remind Germania that we have the capacity to strike fast, and strike hard. Such a gambit would surely bring them to the table and halt their madness.\n\nAnd if they try anything, well, we'll be closer to them than ever before."
USA_Land_Down_Under_desc:0 "Australia, liberty's last ocean in the Western Pacific, has lived under the constant threat of Japanese invasion for over twenty years. It's time that the extension of the OFN nuclear umbrella be made that much more tangible for our Aussie allies, to provide them with the air bases and tactical missiles that will tip the scales in their favor against the numerically-superior Japanese adversary."
USA_Nuclear_Sub_Dev_desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean is vast and almost impossibly deep in areas - perfect cover for a new fleet of ballistic missile submarines, waiting for the signal to deliver atomic retribution against the Japanese enemy. But the Japanese, with a presence from Hawaii to the former East Indies, will doubtless be vigilant against any intrusion by our silent service. The underseas arms race is on; our submarines must be engineered for victory..."
USA_Speaking_Softly_desc:0 "The Germans and Japanese must be made to understand that America does not hide behind the moat of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. American submarines hide in the vast oceans, bringing nuclear annihilation to the very doorstep of our enemies; and should the Japanese or Germans sweep the seas clean, they will find American bombers and missiles waiting to strike beyond the range of their precious navies. If they want to reverse the tables and strike first, we will know, and beat them to the punch.\n\nAmerica can, and will, win a nuclear war. The sooner Japan and Germany realize that, they will realize the folly of continuing the arms race, and come to the table to seek a new accommodation."
USA_The_Sanctity_Of_The_OFN_desc:0 "Even in negotiations between the superpowers, America is made stronger by the presence and support of its allies in the OFN. They are partners - not the feudal liege lords of German or the colonial kleptocracies of the Japanese - and even if they do not have a seat at the table, they deserve to be consulted and kept informed of where we seek to lead the OFN, to the ultimate goal of our nuclear diplomacy - if not peace in our time, then at least peace through strength."
USA_Readying_The_Big_Stick_desc:0 "Just in case the Germans and the Japanese thought all of our previous military posturing and development was just a dog-and-pony show, we'll make sure that we have a demonstration of the latest and greatest American military inventions and hardware, for all the world to see. It would be a terrible waste for this to actually ever be used, of course, and we're counting on the Germans and Japanese seeing it the same way we do."
USA_Seven_Second_Detection_desc:0 "Contingency planning and redundancies must be built into every strategy. What if the enemy overpowers our forward warning stations in Australia and Iceland by surprise? America cannot be left defenseless due to its reliance on forewarning from distant shores. We will install a final set of early warning radars in Canada and Alaska; if we ever end up dependent on these systems, the window to retaliate will be miniscule, but it will be there."
USA_A_Fragile_Peace_desc:0 "America now maintains the means to destroy its enemies a thousand times over, to take every nuclear weapon in their arsenal and match it - and then some. The quantitative and qualitative superiority of our atomic arsenal is manifestly clear, and our enemies challenge it at their own peril.\n\nWith our nuclear superiority as an article of faith amongst the American public, surely we can afford to be magnanimous. Through the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, we hope to convince the superpowers to take a step back from the precipice of oblivion. We do not seek the adulation of Germany and Japan: only that their representatives come to the table as reasonable men, to promise the world that the sun will rise tomorrow."
USA_Glenn_Closing_Empathy_Deficit_desc:0 "Although our administration's aims lie towards the heavens, it is within our responsibility to remember our duties at the ground level. With that, the other half of our focus ought to be on the state of the United States' social welfare. Consistently, our government has overlooked the needs of our nation's neediest, and most downtrodden souls. Thus, we must act quickly to lift the spirits residing in the workers and veterans of America who have been so greatly beaten down, in order to secure not only a more stable nation, but a caring one as well. Besides, if we manage to please American citizens enough with our work towards economic security, they will be more than approving of our desires to fund NASA, right?\n\nTo start, our administration will work to reform pension programs for the retired elderly population of the United States. Regularly, their hard work has not paid off in their retirement, leaving them mistreated in care, but our administration will work to change that."
USA_Glenn_THe_Neediest_desc:0 "In drafting the bill for pension reform for the country, the administration has discussed the possible expansion of the developing legislation. In particular, we have realized that a large group of good, yet pained people that have gone overlooked by the government and the people of the United States: the disabled citizens of America. Consistently, disabled Americans overcome the difficulties of their conditions, yet receive no care for the lengths they go through to provide for themselves and their families. Our administration seeks to reverse this injustice, and will reach out to the disabled to bring them a brighter day by offering greater pensions toward them and their families. Furthermore, increased benefits will provide care for the military veterans who, through fighting for their nation, were forced to come home with debilitating injuries, particularly from the Second World War, and will seek to provide for their families as well. Besides, it's what Annie would want, right?"
USA_Glenn_THe_Downtrodden_desc:0 "With the work our cabinet has put into developing the inclusions we need in this bill to bridge every gap in American empathy, the most unfortunate persons of our society have been noted in being consistently looked past by Presidents of history as well. Here, we see the poor and destitute, those with little to no economic stability in their lives to begin with, and suffer throughout their lives with the difficulties they were born in, rather than created for themselves. With respect and care for such individuals, the proposed bill will include a section regarding the expansion of financial security nets and payments towards the Americans who find themselves living in a state of poverty. With this, we shall engage in a great fight against the issue of increasing poverty for the lives of American citizens across the country, and provide for them a method of escaping the circumstances they have been dealt with. "
USA_Glenn_Pension_Security_Bill_desc:0 "With the revisions towards the legislation finalized, our administration will send the bill towards vote in the Congress. Although many in our nation believe such a bill to be an "insult towards the Treasury," we will do all we can to make sure that the bill is secured for the less fortunate in our society. We, as Americans, are promised to live within a nation that champions freedom, justice, prosperity, and progress, and the bill we have composed will only expand upon the possibilities of living in a greater and empathetic society. The elderly, the disabled, and the less fortunate are Americans all the same, and thus deserve the right to a fairer society for them, and thus will enjoy a substantial increase in their provisions for all that they have equally suffered. Though many in the House and Senate believe the bill to be far too expensive, and a "political distraction from the President's extreme fascination with space," we must do what we can for our nation."
USA_Glenn_Beat_Big_Pharma_desc:0 "With the rapid advances of technology regarding health, the average American citizen's illnesses have been well studied and can easily be taken care of. However, they must bear with the suffering of paying the outrageous prices of the towering pharmaceutical companies, choking the average citizen who may be already suffering from a wide range of health issues. Such companies have taken a mix of shadowy economic strategies and hurting average Americans, and it is absolutely unacceptable to allow such practices to continue. Our administration will bring "Big Pharma" back in the line of acceptance. We will issue several restrictions on these companies' activities, and stand resolute in our fight against their monopoly of the health industry, as an industry that seeks to serve the sick and dying ought to act morally sound and economically responsible."
USA_Glenn_Secure_Workplace_desc:0 "The American worker, one of the cornerpieces in American economic stability, has been in a crisis for a great amount of time. Throughout contemporary history, workers have experienced great inequality in their respective workplaces, and while Unions aimed to fix this, their lack of membership due to American Right to Work Laws have restarted the imbalances within the workplace. To combat this, we must draft a bill which would tear down the Right to Work laws which have created such imbalances in the workplace. In doing so, workplaces may require the workers within to be a part of the associated union, stopping the imbalance of workers who receive the benefits of union membership without actually committing the sacrifice of official membership. With this, American workplaces will become a far more fair and just area of American life, building confidence for the fearful American workers to instead live, and work, towards greater unity and prosperity."
USA_Glenn_Unkept_Promisse_desc:0 "After fighting constantly in regards to the reformation of several pension programs, we have already made strong leaps into progress for social welfare programs in American society. However, every program created thus far has been aimed towards a specific group, and it's time to look outward, into a Social Security program for every American citizen around the nation. The beginning of such a creation will act as a new means of providing for the average man and woman, and usher in a new wave of confidence and prosperity in a time of financial fears and instability. In safeguarding Americans from financial failure, and offering provisions in the case of economic recession, we will put many Americans' fears of progress to rest, and allow the American economy to expand as it never has before. Yes, while it may be at the cost of government funding, is it not the care and concern of the people that we are looking to expand upon in the first place, and offer them happiness in such dire times?"
USA_Glenn_Rally_the_Republicans_desc:0 "With the Social Security Program having begun the process of drafting, we have managed to build towards abiding the fears of American citizenry in regards to financial situations. We must stand resolute in our support and joy at the prospect of reaching out to the people of the United States with the ideas of the bill, and thus, must rally support for our work throughout the states to maintain its success. In particular, the Northern and Midwestern Republican branch of the Republican-Democrats has been in celebration over the creation of such Social Security measures, and we must capitalize on the situation to increase public approval of our administration, and show that the American people are confident in the controversial program. Doing so will allow the party to reorganize, consolidate, and expand, offering the administration a large amount of support, and being able to continue advances towards the United States' success."
USA_Glenn_Beat_Down_the_Dems_desc:0 "Our success in the progress of creating Social Security Act has allowed Americans to enjoy a newfound confidence in American economics and financial stability, allowing the continued growth of our nation through the work of the everyday citizen. However, while we are overjoyed at our successes so far with American confidence in the bill, many in the nation remain fearful over the costs imposed upon the federal government in the passing of such an Act. We cannot allow such notions of fear and anxiety to plague American society and cause the death of our program before it's even been signed into law. Thus, it is our imperative to beat the Democratic side of the Republican-Democrats back in line, as they have expressed their ardent disapproval throughout the South and other areas of the nation. Doing so will nip the fears of Americans in the bud, and allow our administration to move forward in aiding American citizens and generating progress for the future."
USA_Glenn_Friends_Center_desc:0 "While Americans across the nation have remained divided over a plethora of issues, it is not without question that the possibility of success through bipartisan efforts is there, even if hard to find. So, it is time to reach out: the Central branch of the NPP has remained steadfast in their desire to aid American citizens and empower the American worker, and with our steps toward a Social Security Act, we must reach out to our friends within the Center-National Progressive Party. Doing so not only allows us to garner further support on the bill, but also serves to end the fears of many Americans as well, as seeing that the two parties which divide the United States' political system working together will bring massive support for our administration, even if opposition towards the bill still remains vocal, within our own party as well as the National Progressive Party. We must stand together if we are to see the empowerment of the American worker!"
USA_Glenn_Hammer_the_Language_desc:0 "While we have managed to organize the supporting base behind the creation of the Social Security Act, we need to get to work on the next most important part of its creation: the writing and contents of the bill itself. Obviously, the bill is proving to be one of the most extensive social programs organized in American history, but we need to be effective in its wording and focus so that we do not lose the program to inefficiency and bureaucracy. The paragraphs of the bill must be examined by the administration and experts alike to guarantee its success. Furthermore, the bill has already proved to be controversial since its conception, especially amongst the National Progressive Party's right-leaning branch, and so we must consider who this bill will be going up against and how to make it both successful and viable. Americans have long faced difficulties for their nation, we are long overdue for a program created to pay them back for everything they have done for their nation."
USA_Glenn_Stop_Southern_desc:0 "Many in the administration back the foundations of the Social Security Act; however, fears continue to spread throughout the public and governmental levels. Having said that, there is an obvious group to point to in nominating suspects for such fear-mongering: the Dixiecrats within the R-D's remain strong in their opposition towards the bill, and have dared to claim that its "lack of functionality will only be matched by its costs." With that, we must remind them that the Republican-Democratic Party must stand together, and in doing so, they must be willing just as much as the Republicans have been in complying to Democratic demands. Thus, we shall discipline the Southern Democrats that seek to bring down the success our party has had, even if extreme elements of the NPP will grow in their absence. The American people are crying for help, and this act will supply the Republican-Democrats with the approval they are needing nowadays, even if the Democrats have complaints about the issue."
USA_Glenn_Social_Security_Act_desc:0 "The Administration, the Cabinet, experts from a multitude of academic fields, people from a wide range of groups have met to discuss, debate, and finalize changes and amendments to the clauses of the Social Security bill. Americans are ought there suffering from their lack of financial confidence, and it will not get better without action. However, after months of work, the Glenn administration has found it to be the right time to introduce the bill to Congress to be voted into law. The various factions of the American government have already rallied to taking sides and made up their mind about the bill. With hope, the Congress of the United States ought to be more than willing to accept the act of care we have pieced together, and we must move fast before our support is lost. Once American citizens stand proud for our administration with such success, we may move forward with the more pertinent projects as well, and channel funding to Space Administration later."
USA_Glenn_Clean_Gov_Best_Gov_desc:0 "While successful in our progress towards social reform, the administration has a new worry to focus on which continues to bring down public opinion of the government: the damned corruption found all over the place! Ever since Nixon, the American public has been worried sick over the possibility of public disgraces such as the corruption found within Nixon's wrongdoing. Even worse, as Nixon's actions did not only affect the federal government as a whole, but specifically the Republican-Democratic Party's stability! Failure is not an option within the American government, and it's about time we make sure of it. It's time we dredge up and throw out any remaining factors of corruption within our government. It is within our best efforts to make sure that we have earned the trust and respect of the citizenry before we experience chaos on a national level. In earning their trust, we can show them that we mean the best for them, and are not just selfish politicians of the day."
USA_Glenn_Crack_Down_On_Corruption_desc:0 "Although our successes as an administration have been fruitful for the American people, the successes of the working man have revealed a blanket of corrupt ties towards current legislation. The continuous complaints to the general public about our administration revealed a key detail in their monopolous control over the market: the tax incentives present in current legislation allows these massive businesses to continuously grow bigger, eventually giving way to the establishment of unfair business practices. Considering our administration's aims at cutting out unfair business practices as well as the destruction of corrupt elements of the government, it is without a doubt a necessity to repeal such tax policies, as it is unquestionable that these huge marketplaces have already sunk their fortunes into the pockets of Representatives and Senators vouching for them. For the sake of American fairness and equality, we must deal with this burden on society."
USA_Glenn_Empower_Senate_Ethics_Commitee_desc:0 "The United States government, having acted in the people's goodwill for so long, has an unfortunate underbelly of corrupted history found within. Though our Executive Branch has been the focus of corruption, we must expand our focus towards the Legislative Branch as well. With such foul acts of criminality existing in the very lawmaking body of our nation, we must build new foundations to ensure that we can clean up any spots of corruption in the United States Congress. Having said that, it is our administration's prerogative to empower the Senate Ethics Commission, as such a political body can serve the country has both a watchdog and cleanup service for any dark spots of corruption found within our Representatives and Senators. No longer will the acts of bribery and intimidation l stain the legislative process of our constitutional Republic; instead, we shall remain acting as a strong, resolute, and morally sound government that acts purely for the sake of the American citizen."
USA_Glenn_Fight_Off_Big_Buisness_desc:0 "Although we have successfully moved forward with establishing future methods of dealing with corrupt actions of United States politicians in the future, it would be dishonest to claim that we do not suffer from such disgusting acts of injustice in our government body already. The American people have already grown sick and tired of corrupt actions of the government with the blemishes of the past, and it is our duty to reach out to such weary souls and bring them hope. So, we will launch a full-scale investigation into any hints of corruption that may spring up in our government, whether it's one lawmaker or one hundred, it is our duty to make sure every bit of it is stamped out. The gross faults of the leaders of the United States in the past have allowed countless citizens to suffer under the burden of corruption, allowing for such low-reaching souls to prosper while the honest man falls, and we cannot allow such injustices to happen in our prosperous democracy any longer."
USA_Glenn_Ban_Lobbying_desc:0 "Finally, our administration has managed to put the boot down upon the lobbying groups that took the reigns of our nation unfortunately so long ago. With enough work and effort put together by the Cabinet, we have managed to unshackle American leadership in being able to lead how they want, not how lobbyists want. Now, however, we have them on the defense, and we have waited long enough to finally begin pushing for our final move against their injustice: a complete ban on political lobbying within our nation. Injustices towards the American people are wrought within these groups, and far too much has corruption allowed to flourish in democracies in our world, and to imagine it within our nation is disgusting. We must make the final move, as banning lobbying groups will hopefully be strong enough to push our leaders far back from any corruptive acts which may sway their acts in office. Instead, we shall act as a more just society, without any restrictions from the scum of lobbying."
USA_Glenn_Just_Restrict_Lobbying_desc:0 "The practice of lobbying has gone unchecked by lawmakers whose pockets were filled with the money given by the very political bodies that expand the very practice itself. Thus, we cannot allow our administration to trust any such bodies that dole out American dollars to politicians stooping at their level. Rather, we must begin the process of forwarding legislation that tightens the grip on the activity of lobbying, with establishing limits on the size of such groups and clamping down on the flow of money from these groups to our esteemed leaders. It is without question that a large amount of Senators and Representatives have allowed themselves to accept the process and profit from it, and so many will find our efforts to be "far too idealistic" for their standards. However, we live in a free American democracy, and we cannot allow such groups to taint our nation's leaders into changing our laws for profit."
USA_Glenn_A_City_On_A_Hill_desc:0 "With a shining sun, a gentle breeze, a fairer economy,and a happy and healthy American populace, we have, rest assured, done what we can to make sure that the United States of America is better off then when we came in, as every American politician ought to wish to do. And now, with our help, leaders are no longer being clamped down by lobbyist's schemes, and with that, we have already seen happiness within Americans. The effort put into social reform ought to have done more than enough to win over hearts and minds, and with our efforts to help the broken, we have managed to create a more caring society as well. Around the world, democracy has been harmed by the stains of dictators and corruption, but we have done what we can to make sure that the United States can stand as an example for abroad. America is beautiful, and Americans are a worthwhile people to care for, and now that we have, it is time to move forward in history, and look more into the future: into the Heavens above."

glenn.1.desc:0 ""Hunt, Jacobson, Jethro, Johnson, Judd.." Gore continued.\n\nGlenn had been trying to pay attention to the long list of names that his Vice President was reading off to him. Each name a different figure in the West Wing of the White House. Each name listed another individual with different aspirations and goals, with some against one another or even against ourselves. It had only been a few days since Glenn's swearing in as President and he was already feeling the exhaustion of the bureaucracy found within the federal government.\n\n"Lamont, Lane, Lang-" Gore continued.\n\n"Al, just a minute. You'll wear yourself out going through all that, let's take a minute to think about all of this. Look at all those names you've listed off already, and you're only on the twelfth letter of the alphabet. Doesn't that tell you something?" Glenn asked.\n\n"We're losing most of our budget on White House aids?" Gore said, giving Glenn a good laugh out of it.\n\n"Well, you're not entirely wrong, Gore. Think about it: our campaign was built on several foundations, but all of these names are adapted to the last President's set. If they continue on as they have been, they will never be able to adapt to the administration's goals. We've fought so hard to get where we are, and we can't just let all of this slow us down. The people are suffering out there, Al, they want progress, and Hunt and Judd and Lamont are not going to be the ones that get us out there."\n\nThe Vice President nodded his head slowly to the President's statement. "What will you have me do then, John?" Gore asked.\n\n"Well, firstly, that list there might give you a headache, might want to get rid of it. Instead, let's come up with another list. A list of people who have our dream, who have that want to get out there, and bring this country farther than it ever has before, Al. We fight for America, and we need to find those who will do the same with us."\n\nWith a smile and a handshake, Gore left the room to handle the President's request."

He promised to unite the country after years of division, to bring each citizen closer together, to help those who need it most, and to bring the country out farther than it has ever reached before. Having gone through enough time to prove himself in the Presidential seat, reports indicate that the administration is most definitely focusing on advancing; however, have they forgotten the rest of their campaign promises?\n\nAlthough there have been no official statements, many White House reports show a continuous focus towards the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with recent actions in the West Wing allowing for nearly double the staff held in NASA before, as well as stark increases towards the program's funding. Furthermore, many analysts have noticed a steady increase in ties to such activities within the Congressional branch as well, as roughly half of senatorial meetings and hearings have been in regards to the aviation industry and the country's possible future in the exploration of Space. However, it has been noted that President Glenn's administration has not given any public attention towards recent events, as the only official willing to give a statement was Howard Metzenbaum, the President's Chief of Staff, who said that, "the President promised Americans the possibility of growth and prosperity in manners they have not seen before, and the administration is working diligently in an effort to ensure this happens." Reporters are on standby to investigate the situation and developments come in."

Great flashes of lightning and the booming cannons of thunder coated continued to rage and took hold across the dark clouds above the White House, while showers overtook the streets and drowned out the vegetation of the nation's capital. There, President John Glenn slept soundly, warmed by the covers of the bed and his loving Anna in the dark room he called home throughout his Presidency.\n\n"Raumfahrer-Ein, Zwei, and Drei hitting the surface now." Köllner said, as the craft touched down upon the grey wasteland, with a great blue and green sphere floated thousands upon thousands of miles behind them. Honored by his leadership, Köllner was declared to be the first to take the first step. And thus, the proud German floated softly to the surface of the Moon. He turned to grab something out of the landing craft, and walked forward several places. "For Germania, to the stars and beyond." He said as he planted the flag adorned with a black Swastika to forever stare back at his home planet. There, millions of Germans celebrated across the Reich, taking part in a celebration to honor the glory, the wonder, the majesty of the Reich's power. Across the seas, however, Americans within the capital were devastated by the events of the past few hours. Men and women stood, crying into one another's shoulders. Project leads cursed and kicked, going so far as vandalizing their work stations in anger. Hours felt like days, and with every passing moment, the repercussions of their failure became apparent: projects were left in dark rooms' shelves, workers were leaving far earlier than they were scheduled to, and new reports of budget slashes came with every passing hour. Tears stained the once successful organization's pride.\n\n"J-J-John, are you alright?" Anna said as she shook her husband. The President rocketed back up within his bed, as cold streams of sweat journeyed down his forehead, burning his eyes. He looked as his wife's worried expression while he wiped away the sweat, thinking about everything that had transpired within his dreams. The President realized what had happened, and did the only logical action in his mind next: he gave a large embrace to his wife."

Nelson Rockefeller said to the concerned expression worn by President Glenn. "Regarding the Germans, sir, they would most likely have spread out their nuclear weapons across the multiple fronts they have to deal with; however, our main concern would most likely be within secret coverage within their French puppet or even near the Northern Sea in Wilhelmshaven to launch into the Atlantic and preparing a nuclear strike by sea."\n\nThe reports laid out by his Secretary of State did not smother the worries held by the President of the United States' rivals' nuclear capabilities. Years of tension did not play to the favor of peace and "common manhood" within the enemies' eyes, as far as the President was concerned. However, if the years of experience piloting aircraft taught John Glenn anything, it was not to panic in the middle of a crisis, unless you seek to crash and burn. Another lesson taught to John Glenn during his time as a pilot was a simple rule, but an effective one: the man with the bigger gun is going to win the fight. With the air capabilities already being improved with the funding for NASA, there remains but one obstacle ahead for the nuclear arms race: nuclear power itself. Glenn picked up his office phone and spoke into it, "Hello, ma'am, could you patch me through to Javits?"\n\n"Absolutely, sir, the Defense budget more than allows the research program to go through, and we could absolutely coordinate with them to work towards a greater missile supply.

As the years move on, one by one, Glenn can't help but recall the beauty of his childhood in 1928, when he flew in his first airplane alongside his father, and looked outwards into the beautiful Ohioan landscape, with the heavens above him and the powerful figures beneath him like a man watching over an anthill.\n\n"Now, as I said before, Mr. President, the Dresden Generating Station and myself, Executive Director Fergusson, greatly appreciate your visitation to the reactor and the approval for its creation, as we hope to serve the great citizens of Illinois!" the executive director said, shaking the President from his nostalgia.\n\n"Ah, yes, speaking of which, I was wanting to ask: how many people will this provide power for?" the President asked.\n\n"Oh, ah, well, Mr. President, the full potential of the facility is still being estimated; however, at startup, we believe the facility should be able to power all of Morris as well as a great deal of Chicago, resulting in current estimates reaching about one and a half million homes!"\n\nThe director's statement shocked the President. One and a half million people, one and a half million functioning households, one and a half million happy Americans to live another day in warmth and happiness thanks to the work of nuclear energy. Soon, the President stood within dreams of American households across the nation being able to thank the government for both providing a healthy and happy means of energy production, but an entire way of life, with America standing at the top of the globe by taking a new step into the future of progress, glory, and potential. A new age for the United States was ready to begin.\n\n"Umm, Mr. President, are you okay?" Director Fergusson asked as the President stared at a window into the facility."

The President sat, silent, gazing at the television sets before returning to meet the eyes of his staff. Metzenbaum and Rockefeller both felt uneasy at the President's reaction to the uplifting news of the television program, as he seemed dreadfully upset by the news.\n\n"Mr. President, is everything alright?" Metzenbaum finally chimed in, breaking the silence of the room.\n\nImmediately, Glenn barked back at the men, "The both of you, follow me, now."\n\nThe two men quickly followed Glenn, awaiting the news that could possibly have the typically gleeful President so perturbed after the great news. Finally, the President escorted the men to an inconspicuous car, making for the driver's seat, and hurdling off into the Maryland evening. The car ride was silent. Finally, Glenn parked on a hill, shrouded in darkness, but offering a beautiful look over the White House and several beautiful sights of the D.C. area.\n\n"Get out."

The President lifted the trunk door, where the two men saw an ice chest, which the President took hold of and turned to the men.\n\n"My one regret," the President said, "is that I couldn't share a beer with the two men who made this all possible.

Gone were the days of committing to executive and decisive military decisions on behalf of the United States Armed Forces; no, now all LeMay had to do was pick between these two idiots on who to run the nuclear movie to help win Americans over. On one side, we have Juran: while not heavily regarded for the plot of his movies, do we really need that when we're focusing on scaring the American public into realizing that we need nuclear missiles? Man could think of horrific images to make for film that even LeMay hadn't seen before. Meanwhile, on the other side, we have Kubrik, the ever famed, and ever assholic movie director who seems to be thinking he's gonna be making Beethoven's 5th. To his credit, Kubrik can make a fantastic war movie, and even LeMay can attest to that one.\n\nNow, as the two men argue back and forth, it's time to decide: do we go full on and scare the hell out of America with Juran, or ease into it with Kubrik?"

At present time, the United States wields strong control over the Shinkolobwe (also called Hermannsville) mine, as well as a looser hold upon the surrounding Katanga region. Resource extraction is currently being initiated, and rail lines to South Africa are being set up such that the resources may be exported back to the United States.\n\nForces of the 1st Marine Division and 101st Airborne Division attacked the mine as their first major target in the region, coming under fire from what were later confirmed to be soldiers of the German S.S., presumably left over from the fall of the Reichskommissariats in Africa. Some officers have conjectured that the Germans were exporting the uranium from the mine back to Europe, but most experts of USAFRICOM disagree. The Germans were put under heavy fire by marines arriving in gunboats, while airborne flanked using helicopters, leading to many of the remaining Germans being killed or fleeing. As far as is currently known, casualties from this initial strike number 40 American killed or wounded, with over 300 German killed.\n\nFollowing the success of the attack on Shinkolobwe, the marines spread out through the jungle in pursuit of the retreating S.S. elements, meeting none. Meanwhile, the 101st, assisted by US Navy reconnaissance jets, attacked several surrounding villages and towns, most notably Likasi (also known as Jadotstadt).

These two seemingly opposed groups realized the plan of the United States military to secure the region, and acted exceptionally quickly in response, notably through the formation of a temporary alliance.\n\nThese groups amassed a strike force of over 4000 men to attack the stronghold of Likasi, along with minor attacks on surrounding villages and the vital Shinkolobwe mine. On the night of the 10th, they executed their plan. Using abandoned or repurposed German light armored vehicles, former German S.S. elements attacked from the south, through the village of Panda. Simultaneously, Congolese warlord and revolutionary elements attacked from the north and east, firing significant amounts of artillery on undermanned and unsuspecting American positions.\n\nFailing to realize the dire nature of the situation, the forces of the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines under the command of Major Charles E. Wilhelm believed that their numbers and those of the Africans were roughly equal, when in fact they were closer to a 5-to-1 ratio. They were surrounded in the middle of the town, with little access to armor or heavy weapons. Without hope for evacuation by air, due to a failure to establish radio contact with other military elements, the Major Wilhelm decided to hold off the majority of the attacking force with only a company of marines, while the remainder would attempt to reach riverboats and retreat to a forward operating base just downriver. This strategy appears to have worked, though it would seem that the Major and his company were captured and then executed. Platoon-strength elements of the surrounding towns failed to report whatsoever, and are presumed MIA. In total, American casualties from the engagement number at least 400, and possibly up to 600.\n\nWith so many American dead, it has become impossible to hide this operation from the American public any longer.

The attack utterly shattered the thin alliance between the warlords, revolutionaries, and S.S. forces under Heinz Barth, sending them retreating back into the jungles with significant casualities.\n\nThe attack was centered around the village of Panda, just to the south of Likasi, where American close air support drew S.S. units out of their entrenched positions with use of napalm and white phosphorus munitions. Once drawn out, helicopter elements of the 101st Airborne surrounded and destroyed the fleeing German units. This then cleared the way for the several brigades of the 1st Marine Division to cross the Panda River and march on Likasi from the south and southwest. Meanwhile, the remainder of the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, supported by reinforcements of the 1st Battalion and close air support, advanced on the Likasi from the east. The Africans, likely having seen the destruction wreaked upon the S.S., broke formation and retreated to the north after only a few minutes of combat.\n\nDespite the temporary setback, it appears much of the imported mining equipment is still intact.

The S.S. remnants, equipped with highly-effective German weaponry, also impeded the marines.\n\nThe initial planned attack proved unnecessary, as reconnaissance showed the town of Likasi to be abandoned. Upon arriving at the town, the marines found nothing more than burning buildings and mass graves filled with American servicemen. Distressed by this discovery, the Africans, now emboldened and in greater numbers than during the previous attack, sent small groups of soldiers to prod the marines into an engagement. Taking the bait, the marines chased the Africans into the jungle, where they found themselves quickly divided and surrounded by the Africans' superior numbers. In addition, the formerly-S.S. warlord Heinz Barth sent several APCs which the marines struggled to destroy. In a dire situation, the marines called for air support, but due to poor visibility through the jungle canopy, several bombs were dropped on American positions, killing and wounding many.\n\nOverall, the operation was an abject failure. Reaction at home, though somewhat dulled due to the lack of information, can be described as extreme. The Department of Homeland Security is recommending a full withdrawal in anticipation of nationwide protests and riots, and I am inclined to agree.

Overall, the enemy appear to have suffered 37 dead, while the engineers lost 25 men with another 39 wounded.\n\nWhile this defeat was quite small and had with a minimum of casualties, the marines were caught totally off-guard, and it is the United States' greatest loss in the region since the fall of Likasi.

The catwalk was purely for inspecting the missile; should anyone be in here when the rocket launched, may God help their mortal soul. Regardless, barring the start of total nuclear war, no missiles would be launched today.\n\nGlenn stood admiring the massive, cylindrical creation of aluminum and steel, with a heart of plutonium. It was awe-inspiring. The power of gods, sitting right before him, with the judicious ability to wipe the face of the Earth clean. However, unless pushed to the edge, America would never fire first. It had these purely for defense, of course; insurance, in case the worst came to pass. He turned to the director of this new facility, a man named William Baughman.\n\n"What's the range on this missile?"\n\n"The Minuteman III claims a range of around 13,000 kilometers," he said, "that's roughly 8,000 miles, and farther than any other missile currently in service on the planet."\n\n"Incredible," the President said, "and they don't even know we have it. Krauts and Nips would be shaking in their boots if they knew all the stuff we got up to. America needs a strong nuclear defense, and I'm glad my administration was able to help provide for it.""

glenn.24.desc:0 "Jack sat down on the couch with an ice cold bottle of suds, ready to enjoy an hour or two of TV before heading back outside for more yard work. He clicked on the TV, his small antenna catching only the most powerful signals over the air. The display flickered to life, showing a black and white broadcast of what appeared to be President John Glenn, examining some variety of bomber aircraft. Several of them flew overhead while the President himself admired a stationary one on the ground. The President and his entourage then moved over to the side of the runway they were standing on.\n\nJohn Glenn turned to face a reporter who was slightly out of frame. "So why do you think this new bomber is so revolutionary, Mister President?" asked the reporter, in that half-condescending, weirdly intonated reporter-voice that they always used.\n\n"Well, for starters, it's easily the fastest bomber in the world. The B-1 Lancer can reach a top speed of over 1.25 times the speed of sound. You know, a lot of people ask me why we don't just replace bombers completely with missiles. Well, for one, if we have a false alarm, and we start to send out bombers, we can always bring 'em on back. With a missile, once you launch it, it's not coming back. A pilot has discretion, as well. He's able to gauge the value of a target; whether it's a threat or not, or whether it's worth hitting. In short, I think that the new B-1 Lancer is going to greatly strengthen our nuclear triad. It's, simply, a fine new jet. Now let's watch one give us a little show, eh?"\n\nWith that, the President turned and gave a thumbs up, presumably to the pilot of the bomber he was examining just moments ago. The massive jet fired up it's engines, and promptly threw the President on to his ass, rolling backwards like an armadillo, and his aides following suit, scrambling over to help but only being knocked down themselves.\n\n"Well damn," muttered Jack, "must be a helluva jet to knock the President on his ass.""

Stepping through the sparkling glass doors, and trailed by several black-clad agents of the Secret Service, the astronaut-turned-president found himself greeted by an old friend: James Webb, administrator of NASA. "Hello, James," said the President, smiling.\n\nThe administrator reciprocated with a smile of his own. "A damn fine facility you've let us build, John," he said, "and, by God, a damn fine path it's going to carve for us. Lemme show you around; we've already got several new projects in the works."\n\nThe President and his entourage of guards followed Administrator Webb through the vast halls of the new Houston facility, pointing out new projects along the way. "So, down here we have planning rooms for future programs and technologies; namely, the Orion Project, the Diana Program, and the Integral Launch and Re-entry Vehicle."\n\nThe President shrugged. "I'm a bit out of the loop these days, James. Why don't you fill me in?"\n\n"Well, Diana is the current plan for another attempt at the moon. In theory we could figure out where Apollo went wrong and use that knowledge in future missions. The Re-entry Vehicle Project, or ILRV, is the current plan for a reusable space plane we could use to get things into orbit at lower cost, like satellites to spy on the Krauts and Nips. Orion is... well... we want to launch heavy loads into space by using nuclear weapons as propulsion."\n\n"And what's all this leading up to, if you don't mind me asking?"\n\nThe Administrator smiled, turning around and walking towards a seemingly nondescript door at the far end of the hall. "I was hoping you'd ask that."\n\nReaching the blank door, he opened it and entered, followed by President Glenn. Inside, the room was poorly lit, but filled with bulky computers and desks, all manned by busy men and women. On the walls, illuminated maps of the Red Planet glowed. Terrain and topographical maps of potential landing sites: Utopia Planitia, Valles Marineris, Elysium Planitia, and several others.\n\n"We're already planning?"\n\n"Come on, John," replied Webb, "we've always been planning. It's just been a matter of funding."\n\nPresident Glenn inhaled deeply, gathering his thoughts. "Well," he began, "you'll have as much of that as you need, and more.""

Really excited to be here in Houston with y'all."\n\n"Daniel Gelzer, aerospace, too. Maybe we'll be working together."\n\n"Sure- wait, Webb's up on stage. We should probably quiet down."\n\nThe auditorium went silent as the famous administrator of NASA stepped up to a podium at the far side of the room. He shuffled some papers around and adjusted the microphone. "Ladies and gentlemen, our organization and our nation are about to embark upon great journeys; odysseys through the great void that surrounds our fragile world. You will develop the technologies required to launch such missions. You have been acquired from all over the country, of all colors and creeds, to guide us towards untold discoveries.

On the other hand, we could simply build one massive rocket, powerful enough to get to the moon and back."\n\nGlenn leaned back in his chair, scratching his chin, "well... why not both?"\n\nA short laugh came from the other side of the line, followed by a pause. "...you're serious? Well, uh, we could probably do that. It'd be darn expensive though, John."\n\n"Hmm," said Glenn, "I'll think about it and give you a call back.""

"Hi James," he said.\n\n"Hi John," he replied. "listen, we may have found a wealthy investor for the Diana Program."\n\n"How wealthy?"\n\n"Very. From what he says he could cover up to a tenth of the entire project's cost, in exchange for regular updates on progress. There's a catch, though: his wealth seems suspect. I'd like to have the IRS audit the guy before we accept any money from him."\n\n"Hmm. That might scare him away, though. What's his name?"\n\n"Douglas DeVille."\n\n"I'll think about it.

After all, these were the opening days of a new age of American space exploration. Today, however, that might all come to an end. No longer would the President have to hold NASA's hand in person; rather, the organization could be managed with only a call and a filled coffer. Today, the President would meet with the administrator, James Webb, to formulate a comprehensive plan for NASA's future.\n\nStepping into the meeting room, Glenn noticed that it was empty, save Webb and an intern or some such that he did not know. "Hello, James," opened Glenn, "I hear you've already hammered out what you think would be best. Regardless, I'm always happy to help you."\n\nThe administrator smiled warmly, sitting in his chair. "Well, John, you could say that. Take a seat," he said, "I'll tell you all about it."\n\nThe President took the seat opposite Webb. "Well," he said, "give me the quick-and-dirty."\n\n"NASA today is pursuing so many projects and moving in so many directions all at once that it is simply unsustainable. So, now, every program we fund will have to cross your desk first. Each program has different benefits, and each has a price. The way I figure it, and as much as you and I would want to, we can't afford to pursue every project that might be worth a damn. Not only because it would be expensive, but because it would anger the public. People find the space program to be a novelty, not a necessity; too much money poured into it and America will grow weary of the stars."\n\n"So your job will be organizing all of these programs," replied Glenn, "while I make sure the other areas of government get adequate attention, and that we don't bankrupt the country in the process."\n\n"Yes.""

To me, it never was a race. It was a quest for knowledge. It was a challenge to overcome. It was a mountain at whose peak lay the great beyond, and a glorious future for mankind. We are about to embark upon that quest once more, for our country, for science, and for humanity itself."\n\n"I will not lie to you: this reinvigorated quest will not come without difficulty.

Did Lincoln give up when the South rebelled? Did the Wright Brothers give up when told that a flying machine could not be built? No, they did not.

It seemed like not long ago, this was his second home; even with all the new gadgets everywhere, the feeling of familiarity still lingered. President Glenn watches with delight at the high-tech gravity rooms, the realistic flight simulators, and the country's future space marines operating it all. The President was glad that even with all the technological advancements, NASA's message stayed the same.\n\nIt was time for lunch with the new recruits. Within a few minutes of conversation, Glenn could tell that these guys weren't as nervous about the great beyond as he was back in the day. If anything, they were nervous about talking with the President, but those feelings were gone after an hour. Glenn spent most of the time both reminiscing on his own experiences and marveling at all the up-to-date training methods.\n\nAs the day progressed, President Glenn had to say goodbye to his new friends. As he boarded the plane for Washington, the man couldn't help but feel ecstatic about the future of NASA with him at the helm. At the same time, though, a sense of dread was creeping up on him: if something bad were to happen, he would be solely responsible. If a missile accident were to cost him American lives, he would have to take all the blame. Glenn wonders whether or not his dreadful feelings will cause him to lose sleep."

Recent polls show that these senators have support from the populations of their respective states.\n\nThis kind of division within our party is unacceptable. Under the Glenn administration, we should get the American people thinking about the impending future. We need those habitable bases on Mars, for Christ's sake!

They were looking for a home, a place to settle after the war. Likewise, we saw conquistadors bridge the gap between the New World and the Old World, people like Christopher Columbus discovering the very continent we live on today. Other explorers spread their knowledge across the globe, permitting entire civilizations to connect for the first time. Our people's Manifest Destiny shaped our country into the superpower it is today. Even much of our ocean remains unexplored.\n\nBut now is the time for us to shift our focus to the stars. As the Earth edges closer and closer to nuclear annihilation, we know little about the Great Beyond.

It was his sole mission to bring his native country beyond the space threshold that contained his predecessors. He mused the potential space future of America over some coffee before the phone at his desk rang. To his surprise, it was a NASA official.\n\n"Mr. President, we have been reviewing our Saturn project, and we are close to finishing the heavy payload rocket you requested. Our engineers have been debating whether we should use liquid rocket fuel for the booster or standard rocket fuel. We wanted to ask you since the NASA budget is growing tighter every day."\n\nThe Saturn project! This rocket is going to be the spark that ignites the country's interest in space, and the President would need to respond fast. Glenn knew how expensive liquid rocket fuel was, and if he were to choose this option, all NASA mission costs from now on would increase. This would help to further ensure a successful mission, but due to the increased costs, the public would grow more unhappy. If he were to go with standard rocket fuel, the mission costs would decrease, but the base mission prep would also decrease."

Younger, progressive House members have contacted us to inquire about whether the administration could use its influence over their body to have the Pension Security Bill amended in committee. Specifically they want a proviso requiring expanded pension benefits for those struggling with disabilities acquired over the course of their life.\n\nThe administration had already been weighing whether to raise benefits for those born with disabilities, but this puts the President in a more difficult position. The progressives will be offended if we do not help all disabled, not just some, but at the same the conservative and free market elements of the Party are already critical enough of the proposal as is, they are unlikely to support aiding those who "made poor career choices" or "failed to act in a safe manner."\n\nThe House Majority Leader has proposed a way around this hurdle. A proposed rider for the bill was increased military pensions for disabled veterans. This had NPP support. Should we fold the disabled veterans rider into the amendment for those disabled as adults, we might just get enough NPP support to pass the bill even with defectors from our own party. This will greatly offend the conservatives, though. Should we do it?"

While the bill has already had a section added ensuring that welfare payments for low income households are exempted from pension taxation that would further complicate their already troubled situation, that only worsens the situation they may face upon retirement.\n\nThe progressive faction in the House have presented a package of amendment sections and riders to the bill to address this issue. The amendments authorize the government to access welfare funds to pad the pension checks for low income pensioners, while the riders expand said welfare budgets by increasing social safety nets, unemployment benefits and social assistance programs.\n\nNeedless to say, adding this package to the bill would be a... courageous decision. The conservatives and business lobby are likely to howl bloody murder (or at least "Bukharinist Mania") at expanding welfare via rider, but like with the disability provisions, there is a chance we may be aided by NPP defectors and still pass the bill.

The proposal however enjoys significant support in the northeast, one of President Glenn's most important voter bases. It is politically sensible to pass price controls to at least some extent, but we could never push it through Congress as it stands.\n\nAs such, we will have to do it via executive order, something which is sure to infuriate the opponents of the proposal, especially among states rights proponents with the Democrats. We will also be unable to point the blame at Congress this way, so a choice must be made about how much division in the party we are willing to risk over this matter.

glenn.49.desc:0 "The President let out a hearty laugh in the early hours of the Washington D.C. morning.\n\n"You're kidding me, right?" he asked Metzenbaum, who offered just as wide of a smile as Glenn.\n\n"Not at all, Mr. President, that Senator looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar when he started hearing about some of the anti-corruption measures being drafted and put into effect into current federal processes. Needless to say, I think it was only about ten minutes after that he decided to tuck his tail between his legs and scamper out of the dinner party."\n\nOnce more, the President and the Chief of Staff exchanged some laughter and smiles.\n\n"Now, Mr. Metzenbaum, I sadly have to inform you that we still have to start work at some point today, so let's get to the point: we still need to work on those reports found of the effects of some of the new policies. What do you have for me?"\n\nMetzenbaum unveiled a manilla folder containing a variety of documents inside, before giving it to the President.\n\n"To put it bluntly, sir, the measurements the administration put together and put into effect, well, work. A variety of officials in the government have rescinded deals they had made with less reputable organizations and businesses, and there have been reports that processes in the government are moving faster by as much as 105 percent in some committees."\n\nThe President, though appearing confident and expectant over the news, was, more than anything, proud. Proud of himself of course, but proud of his administration, proud of the work put forward, proud of their progress, and even proud of the officials that turned sides to clean themselves up. The government was one of the aspects of American society that needed to close that gap of empathy present in the modern day, and they had managed to make progress in closing what seemed like an endless canyon of anti-trust and deceit.

glenn.50.desc:0 "Once more, President John Glenn took some time out of his day to look past the curtains held over the windows of the Oval Office. As the sun pierced through the clouds above the city, Glenn breathed in deeply with a large smile. The Ohioan knew that it was going to be difficult to see as beautiful a view as the one he'd been taking in at that moment. But for now, without the worries of the future plaguing his mind, he allowed the songs of the birds to fill his ears, and the warmth of the setting sun to run over his face. The President had become, as so many around the country praised him for being throughout his Presidency, happy.\n\nFor now, Glenn knew that America was ready to take its next steps forward in the world. His administration was not going to last forever, and while there were still issues to handle in American society, he knew that they had done all they could. After so many years, work had been put through to close that sorrowful gap of empathy that was present for so many years in the saddened American society. The weak, the needy, and the downtrodden had finally received the work they needed to rise out of their pits of sorrow and pain. The people of America, both the abled and disabled, all had a form of financial security to hopefully guide them into a healthier, happier, and brighter future. For once, the people of the United States managed to see that a part of their government had truly become freed from the reigns of corruption, even if by the smallest amount. After such long periods of suffering for Americans across the country, Glenn knew that now hope stood strong in the hearts of the citizens he had guided for his term in office.\n\nWith such images of hope and greatness flowing through the President's mind, he had been reminded that not all of the world shared such similar stories of success and steps forward. The beaten down men, women, and children across Europe had suffered long in their continuous battles against their vicious oppressors. Similarly, with even a note of revenge in the United States, the Pacific had remained embroiled in conflict, with man against man across the many islands of the sea. However, something changed: they had somewhere to look for hope. An example, a shining example, of what they could be, what they ought to be, and the beautiful sight of the future ahead if they made sure they could become as prosperous as the United States of America.\n\nGlenn had failed to respond to the opening of the door to his office behind him.\n\n"Mr. President, are you alright?"

glenn.56.desc:0 ""Mhmm. Yep. I see." President Glenn muttered, as he scribbled some notes down quickly on a small notebook retrieved from his pocket, with the Oval Office's phone in the other. "Completely understood, and in doing so, we will consider everything we can for your idea, we are here for the American worker, don't you forget that! Be sure to reach back if there are any other projects we can expand upon! Alright, thank you, George." President Glenn said with a small laugh before hanging up the phone.\n\n"Well, Mr. President, who was that, if I may ask?" Metzenbaum asked, having been called into the Oval Office well into the middle of a phone call.\n\n"Mr. Metzenbaum, I'd like to ask you for some advice. We've already gotten to work on hammering out all the details of this abolishment of the Right-to-Work laws. Now, we have some possibility to reach out even further." the President said.\n\nMr. Metzenbaum could never quite get past the shock of every moment of Glenn's genuine empathy. "Well, Mr. President, the large corporations have already expressed their opposition to such support for the unions, but what did you have in mind?"\n\nThe President sat in silence, pondering the issue back and forth. "Mr. Metzenbaum, I just got off with a colleague working with a few groups to collaborate on some legislative ideas, and he's informing me that unions across the United States have stated their desire to enforce a 6-hour work workday across the board." Glenn said, watching Metzenbaum's typical shocked expression.\n\n"Mr. President, sir, I know that we must care for the American worker, but businesses will be at our party's throats if we reach that far, and the Department of Commerce has established possible economic difficulties if we reach too far out for the unions." the Chief of Staff noted.\n\n"I understand, Howard, but if we aren't going to be the one that reaches out that far, who will?" He said, doling respect out to his justifiably shocked colleague.\n\nThe American workforce has been one of diligence, one of survival, but shouldn't such men and women enjoy the freedom of their lives along with their worklife? Or are they right, and we're all going to pay for it, or worse, the bill gets killed before it can change anything?"

glenn.58.t:0 "Congress Passes Bill Abolishing the Right to Work"
glenn.58.desc:0 "After months of preparation within the West Wing, the bill forwarding the notion of abolishing United States' Right to Work laws has been successfully approved by the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. President John Glenn regards the signing of the bill into law as being a "massive success for the American working citizen, and a crucial part of ending the stranglehold held by unfair workplaces and businessmen in the oppression of their workers." The Glenn administration is not the only group singing praise towards the passage of the bill, as many within the Department of Commerce have given large signs of approval towards the President in his cause to end the difficulties of the American working class.\n\nRight to Work laws safeguarding a worker's right to not participate in a workers' union has been criticised by many common citizens. A coal miner from Virginia offered his applause to Glenn today as he said that "lots of people out there believe that the President is trying to get rid of us workers' rights. However, I'd have to say, in knowing of a lot of folk out there who try to reap the benefits of unions without actually giving anything up, I think he has some pretty damn good intentions in what he's doing up there in the White House." Many such hardworking citizens stood in praise of the bill's final success in the legislative process, and many continue to celebrate into the night, allowing for them to return to work more safe and secure than ever before.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that everyone agrees with the Glenn administration's work to end the Right to Work. Many large business owners have offered criticisms to the press in response to the passage of the bill. "We business owners of America find that this bill is grouping us all together in some form of 'oppressive' class in America today! I run a business, a business with regulations that I find fair, or else I wouldn't have employees in the first place! President Glenn is looking to sink the American economy into the ground!"\n\nAs both parties celebrate and brood over their successes and losses, time can only tell how the American working environment will be changed by the Glenn administration's work."

glenn.59.t:0 "United States Congress Kills Right to Work Abolishment Bill"
glenn.59.desc:0 "The ongoing battle between the business owners of the United States and the Glenn administration over the abolishment of Right to Work laws culminated tonight, with victory on the side of the business owners. Many large corporate leaders offer their cheers and celebrations in the aftermath of the battle within the Congress tonight, as they have successfully reigned in more control over their employees. One such business leader, standing on the steps of the Congressional building, proclaimed that "America will stand to see freedom in her economics without the meddling of the government!"\n\nOn the other side of the battlefield, federal employees, lawmakers, and many other workers within the presidential administration gave a face of solemnity yet strength. President Glenn offered his words in response to the failure of the bill, saying that "We, as an administration, have fought continuously for the rights, safety, and fairness of the lives of American employees throughout the country. Having said that, though we may face defeat on the Congressional floor tonight, we stand ready once more to continue that fight, for all American workers who stand wronged in the face of those stealing away the benefits of their unionization. We will not stop, not today and not tomorrow."\n\nThe bill itself held a very divisive outlook in the eyes of the citizens of America. One of the owners of a large Kentucky-based corporation expressed joy in the killing of the bill tonight, saying that "the President was assuming at best and prejudicial at worst, Americans across the nation won't need to join any sort of union within my business to know that they can find happiness from it." A dockworker from Connecticut, on the other hand offered his condolences to the administration, admitting that "I have seen many of my fellow workmen proceed to take away benefits of our union without paying any form of dues. It's not right, and knowing that I'll have to return without the support of the President's bill makes me sick. We continue to stand with you, Mr. President.""

glenn.60.t:0 "To Subsidize, or not to Subsidize"
glenn.60.desc:0 "President Glenn, all throughout his electoral campaign, pushed for the introduction of Social Security, an idea that was proposed and promptly defeated during the administration of Kennedy Sr. In recent weeks, the President has been pushing for the reintroduction of this concept into reality, in accordance with his campaign promises. In a recent press conference, he said that he and his congressional allies were "currently drafting a new Social Security bill."\n\nIt is unclear exactly how far this new welfare bill will go, but if the President's comments during his campaign are anything to go by, it will likely prove fairly comprehensive and extensive. It will at least cover all Americans over the age of 65 years and those who have disabilities which prevent them from working. There appears to be some debate among the Republican-Democratic party as to exactly how strong these benefits will be. The more conservative congressmen in the party, mainly democrats, have said that the retirement fund offered by the program should only be from the taxes and trusts that retirees put money into during their working years. The more liberal elements of the party, mainly Republicans, claim that while the Social Security trust fund is an essential part of the process, they are simply not enough to cover the needs of most Americans in their twilight years and that the federal budget must be adjusted such that the government directly subsidizes the trust fund. Under this plan, Americans who claim Social Security will receive more in welfare claims than they put in while employed.\n\nShould the President pursue the more comprehensive, subsidized Social Security, the bill is anticipated to lose quite a bit of support from the Democrats, as well as receive a flat-out rejection by the Far Right-NPP. The bill has yet to be fully drafted however, so the question remains: how far will President Glenn go?"

glenn.61.t:0 "A Coverage Conundrum"
glenn.61.desc:0 "In the process of hammering out the details of his soon-to-be-finished Social Security act, President John Glenn has faced significant opposition to exactly how far the medical-aid aspect of the program, called Medicare, will go. The President himself has made it clear that he supports a very strong Medicare system, in which all those over the age of 65 or suffering from a disability have their healthcare expenses met in-full. This would likely require additional government subsidization of Social Security, and an even angrier mob of conservatives in Congress.\n\nThe Democrats, as can be expected, have proposed a more moderate, but still comprehensive plan. In it, Medicare would only cover roughly 30-50% of healthcare expenses for eligible individuals. Wallace F. Bennett, generally considered the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, has declared that he will absolutely not support a Medicare plan that wastes so much money on coverage that the average retiree "doesn't need". Some congressmen in the Far Right-NPP have expressed slight amiability towards the Democratic proposal, but have made it very clear that the President's position is simply unacceptable. Without much conservative support, there is the question as to whether the bill will pass at all. As such, the President and the Party must make a choice between his desire to cover all healthcare costs under Medicare and his need for party unity and bipartisan support on the bill."

The bill, largely based off one proposed by the administration of Kennedy Sr., was narrowly pushed through in a vote hotly contested by the Far Right-NPP. While the more conservative Democrats among the R-D's initially seemed hesitant to sanction such an expensive program, they quickly calmed once they saw that the President was open to compromising on the issue.\n\nUnder this new welfare program, all Americans over the age of 65 years, and those grossly affected by disabilities, are now permitted to claim a monthly financial stipend from the United States government. The actual amount of assistance given by the stipend varies from person to person, as it is based off of percentage of taxes paid during a claimant's working years."

glenn.64.t:0 "Glenn's Social Security Act Fails!"
glenn.64.desc:0 "Unfortunate news out of Washington today as President John Glenn's Social Security Act has been voted down by a narrow margin in Congress. It appears that the President and his progressive supporters underestimated the conservative's willingness to oppose the act, as well as their own ability to vote as a group. Several Republicans walked across the aisle to vote against the bill with their supposed political opponents.\n\nOverall, the whole debacle surrounding the act and its subsequent defeat in the legislature have been largely blamed upon the President, his allies, and their unwillingness to compromise on critical issues with the more conservative congressmen. In addition, the R-D's as a party find themselves much more divided than prior to the bill; it would seem that such a comprehensive and drastic bill has flared up intraparty tensions once more, and the party is one step closer to dissolution.\n\nAs for the average American, life will go on. While they may not have much to live on in their twilight years, they never have before. A large section of the population is up in arms over the Social Security Act's failure, and will likely remain so for some time. One thing is certain: this is not the last we will see of Social Security."

And yet," thought President Glenn, "despite their incredible importance, we have to sink our hands deep into their processes to make sure they stop any corruption from manipulating their jobs." Glenn paced in his office, looking at the papers stacked up on his desk.\n\n"The Senate Ethics Commission is going to change the face of the current legislative process in order to make sure that not a single Senator will be acting without the greater interest in their hearts, but now, we have to worry about the leader: between a Democrat or a Republican." Glenn sat down, and took a look around, the phone on his desk taking his interest first before taking a stack of Social Reform bills and sifting through them. "Promoting a Republican would allow them to create a strong grip over the Congress, and allow us to make it easier for Republican-centered programs and bills to navigate through the already effective process, helping out all those poor Americans who need our help now more than ever." He put the papers back on his desk before massaging his eyes.\n\n"But, the Democrats would probably throw a fit. After all, they're right when they say that getting rid of corruption within the government should not be a partisan effort, and knowing them, they are probably going to accuse us of pinning blame for the corruption on them if we don't put in a Democrat head of the Commission." Glenn hadn't even noticed that the difficult decision had him tapping his foot in his usually serene office."

Opening the door, the President's chief political advisor was standing in the doorway. "Sir, you're going to want to come see this."\n\nThe President got to his office, when he had seen the cause for all the alarm: a message faxed over to his office, from one of the Democratic Senators of Texas. He looked over the document carefully. "Your decision in picking the head of the Senate Ethics Commission was politically-charged and unfair." The President gripped the bridge of his nose, having known that this decision was going to be a brake on progress at worst, and a headache for him at best. "We henceforth demand your compliance in reversing your decision. Doing so will allow the Congress to act unitedly, and allow our party to remain equal without the Republicans or Democrats overtaking one another. Members of our coalition have even voiced desires to defect to the NPP if you do not meet our desires for justice and equality in a Congress soaked to the bone with corruption and injustices. We are doing this for America, Mr. President, as it is our duty to act for our constituents alone, with fairness."\n\n"This is going to make the Republicans chew me up and spit me out if I go along with this." Glenn said, recognizing the dangers in working towards unity within his own party.\n\n"Now, Mr. President, I know this looks bad, but hear me out: if we were to say, keep going, maintain our current course, maybe they will back off, realize that you represent the head of the party, and your knowledge of Presidential matters surpasses their desires.

Metzenbaum said, knocking on the door as he entered. "I believe you are going to wanna see this one." He said, handing the President a sheet of paper.\n\nAnother letter, straight from the defiant senators themselves. "To President Glenn," the paper started out as Glenn silently led. The President flew through a variety of facial expressions in a surprisingly short amount of time. "They're actually gonna back down?" The President said, nearly in shock.\n\n"It appears so, Mr. President." his Chief of Staff responded. "No newsworthy transfers to the NPP have been made, and the Senate stands obedient to your choice for head of the Ethics commission. You have done a fantastic job, Mr. President."\n\nGlenn continued to sit there, as the word "President." continued to echo in his mind as time seemed to slow around him in the office. "That can't be it. Those Senators stood strongly against the administration's choices, it's not like they would just back down after, right?" Glenn thought, as he eyed the room.

Many of you agreed with me. Together we took the first step, and once again, we are lifting our gaze to the skies. Once again, America is headed to space."\n\n"Since then, we have taken many more steps. NASA has been strengthened and remolded into a leading light for science and exploration in this country and the world.

In general, a win-win for everyone.\n\nHowever, it's becoming clear that most of the money earmarked for the NNC are being funneled to civilian uses, with big reactors being built all over the country to power homes and factories. This is great for citizens to see that their taxpayer money is going to a good use to help them with lower power bills and less pollution from coal and oil power plants. But only a trickle is going to the military, to allow the research, modernization and construction of new weapons to provide the "nuclear umbrella" that keeps America safe. The complaints and outrage of the generals and admirals are circulating in the Pentagon, and Strategic Air Command is livid. There are more and more leaks to newspapers about how the military feels they are being sidelined, that there will soon be a gap between the US, Germany and Japan in everything from missiles to submarines to strategic bombers\n\nAlienating the military on what is already proving to be an expensive and controversial program is really bad news.

The President's opponents in Congress and the media are already clamoring to scale back the National Nuclear Commission, re-prioritize its objectives, or even scrap it all together. President Glenn is going to have to fix this, and soon, or else one of his greatest projects will fall apart."

glenn.76.t:0 "Big Oil vs. Nuclear Power"
glenn.76.desc:0 "For over half a century, the world ran on one resource: oil. Even today, petroleum is vital for the economy; to keep the country's cars, ships, trains and planes moving; to refine into chemicals, plastics and synthesized rubber; and to burn in power plants to provide electricity to millions, and natural gas to provide heating. All of modern life depends on the oil industry.\n\nBut now President Glenn is moving aggressively on his plan to build nuclear reactors everywhere, to power the nation with atomic power, through the National Nuclear Commission. That is an increasingly worrying concern for the boards and stockholders of the big oil companies like Exxon, Texaco, Mobil, and Standard Oil of California. If America is less reliant on oil products for electricity and heating, then a huge section of the market will disappear nearly overnight, and they will lose millions, if not billions, of dollars.\n\nAnalysts predicted that it would be years, if not decades, for nuclear power to become cost-effective, and the oil companies had banked on that. Then Glenn came in, subsidizing the building of reactors, and the price of nuclear energy is dropping fast. Soon, it will be cheaper to build a big expensive reactor and then deal with the minimal maintenance costs than it would be to keep prospecting and shipping oil to refineries and then to power plants. That's the last thing the big oil companies need.\n\nOf course, they will never say that it was for their bottom line. No, instead it will be talking about the possible dangers of radiation and meltdowns, the security of oil reserves in Texas, or the use of government funds to subsidize something that the private market would be better to handle. Big Oil, working through shell companies, are going to fund Glenn's opponents such as the NPP, who are not as keen on spending billions to build reactors all over America.\n\nAnything to save the industry that has powered America and the world this far into the 20th century."

glenn.77.t:0 "Not In My Backyard!"
glenn.77.desc:0 "The National Nuclear Commission determined that the best places to build nuclear power plants are in areas with small towns, farmland, and on the edges of major cities: the land is cheaper and easier to access, and to provide new jobs in areas that need them. However, those underdeveloped areas also happen to be close to the iconic small towns of Middle America and the sprawling suburbs that have redefined American life since the end of the war, where a lot of well educated, white, middle class Americans live.\n\nAnd many of those in small towns and suburbia across the US are really not liking the fact that they are now going to be living next to a giant concrete monstrosity of cooling towers and giant reactors.\n\nThe concerns are varied: the ugly buildings, the lower land values, the threat of radiation, the risk of meltdowns, the dangers of nuclear waste, blocking further development, the fact that there is development, and just the loud noises of construction. Tactics to oppose the construction of new reactors are also innumerable: protests at country or town meetings, pickets at construction sites, vandalism of machinery, letters to newspapers, calls for action from state representatives or the local Congressman. The opposition to the NNC is coalescing into a new movement that is being called the "Not In My Backyard", or NIMBY.\n\nWhile much of the new NIMBY movement is grassroots and local, there have been rumors that outside groups are providing funds and support for these groups. Investigations by media outlets have traced the funding through a myriad of people and shell companies, and eventually to the source: America's big oil and gas companies. But these discoveries, often buried and resulting in reporters reassigned or fired, haven't dampened the movement at all."

glenn.78.desc:0 "Nancy was one of the first, and now she was one of the last. She was still coming out to the gates of the big nuclear power plant, her old and worn sign reading "No to Nuclear!" to protest it. The numbers had dwindled a lot since the first stories of how they were going to be building two reactors near town a couple of years ago first came out. Back then, half the town, a couple hundred people, would show up at the planned construction site next to the river, waving their placards, signing petitions, and writing to their representatives in Congress. Nancy led them, for her house was right next to where the plant was going to be built. The last thing she wanted was her children to be turned into bug-eyed mutants with three arms!\n\nConcerns were addressed, promises were made. Security guards kept people away from the roads and into a specially designated protest zone. But as the weeks went on, the concrete cooling towers went up, and the fancy computers and electronics were installed, despite all the chanting and clamouring. The numbers of protesters began to dwindle then: it was going ahead anyway, so why bother? But Nancy and a few dozen refused to give up. What can be built can be torn down.\n\nThe grand opening a few weeks ago was the final nail in the coffin: the guided tours of the plant, the explanation of safety features, did much to satisfy those concerns, and the hiring of locals and the arrival of new families did much to bolster the local economy and keep the local schools viable. Nancy's husband soon declined to come out with Nancy to protest a "done thing," and more and more people said they had other things to do. But Nancy, and her friend Mary, refused to give in.\n\nBut it's been half an hour already, and Mary hasn't shown up. Maybe she was ill? Maybe her son had some extra homework? Or maybe she finally gave up as well?\n\nNancy sighed, letting her sign fall to the ground, as clouds of harmless exhaust billowed from the towers. She picked up her packed lunch, and walked back home."

The Democrat senator bellowed, face red from anger.\n\n"They are so damn expensive because they are," President Glenn replied, maintaining his ice cold nerves. Turns out flying fighter jets and going to space have done a lot to make him calm and collected in everyday life, or when you are President, facing off a bunch of Democrats livid over the cost of the National Nuclear Commission. "If we don't spend the money to make them safe and stable, then we will have to spend more down the line to repair... or worse."\n\n"This damned nuclear program is blowing a hole in the budget," another senator said. "We can't constantly keep borrowing money for all these pie-in-the-sky projects of your's, Mr. President."\n\n"These nuclear plants will more than pay for themselves over their lifetime. Thirty, forty years," Glenn replied. "Lower power costs, less pollution, healthier people. We don't have to pay for Arabian or Persian oil. And the army is going to be stronger, and therefore America is going to be stronger for it."\n\n"That's all well and good, Mr. President," the second senator said. "But we have to worry about the money. And now we are going to have to borrow more, piling on more debt, to pay for all these plants. That's going to be on our children and grandchildren to pay, all so we can have some fancy power plants now."\n\nThe President took a deep breath. "I understand your concerns, gentlemen. And I will keep them in mind. Thank you for your concerns."\n\nThe Democrat senators glanced at each other and began to file out of the Oval Office. Sure, President Glenn had heard them... but was he actually listening?"

glenn.80.t:0 "A Letter From The Joint Chiefs of Staff"
glenn.80.desc:0 ""Mr. President, I received a letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff today. And, well... see for yourself," Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance said, handing the several page long letter to John Glenn.\n\nGlenn took the letter and began to read, frowning as he did so. "So they are angry that we are focusing on nukes? But that is what they wanted!"\n\n"But they are throwing a tantrum at the Pentagon because we aren't spending as much on everything else: tanks, planes, aircraft carriers. Basically the non-nuclear stuff." Secretary Vance sighed. "You can just never make the children with stars on their shoulders happy it seems. Give them nukes, they want tanks. Give them tanks, they want helicopters. And on and on it goes."\n\n"Yeah, they all have their own idea of what will win the next war, and what won't, and that's different from the next guy," Glenn said, setting the letter down, and rubbing his forehead. "So they want a bit of everything."\n\nSecretary Vance nodded. "But we can't do that. Congress would throw a conniption if we ask them for more money. Unless we take it from the NNC, but that will slow the construction of new reactors."\n\nGlenn turned his big chair around, to look out the windows toward the Rose Garden, contemplating his options. Ask Congress for more funds for the military, which they won't like. Divert funding the National Nuclear Commission, which would slow down the construction and development of new reactors or atomic projects. Or tell the Joint Chiefs off, making them even grumpier than they are now.\n\nIt's days like these where Glenn wished he was still an astronaut."

glenn.81.t:0 "Rumbles from the Pentagon"
glenn.81.desc:0 "Word in the Pentagon spreads quickly. In the world's largest office building, with over 20,000 people working in it, news, rumors and gossip always spreads fast. But the news that there would be no additional funding to the Department of Defense due to the National Nuclear Commission program has spread like wildfire. Admirals and Generals alike were apoplectic at the thought of their pet projects that will, for surely, guarantee victory in whatever future battles America will face, was still not getting the funding they needed. Instead, it was more nukes, missiles to launch the nukes, bombers to drop the nukes, and submarines to sneak around with nukes. Because the problem with nukes is that it's a wrecking ball, when sometimes all you need is a flyswatter. There is talk amongst some that President Glenn, a war hero fighter pilot and brave astronaut, had forgotten where he came from, and his time in the White House meant he had lost sight of what was truly important in safeguarding America.\n\nHowever, everyone in the building, from the office workers that deal with the draft paperwork to the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff know that they can't reveal their displeasure at not getting more money. Congress would roast them alive in committee meetings for wanting this money, and the public would not be too keen on having to foot the bill on yet more experimental projects.\n\nSo, while the tempers are high, there will be only a minor ripple that escapes the Pentagon. But that doesn't mean that soldiers, sailors and airmen are happy. Even the Secretary of Defense, and the President himself, knows that morale has grown weaker as appreciation for the military seems to be lagging. Sure, the current budget is all well and good, and the equipment that soldiers have is still top of the line and better than anything in the world... but it can always be better."

glenn.82.t:0 "Rebalanced Priorities"
glenn.82.desc:0 "There had been rumors that the military was less than pleased with all the extra money that was being spent on nuclear weapons and the systems to deliver them through the National Nuclear Commission. All the extra funding going toward reactors and research was feared to be dulling the edge of America's conventional weapons: the tanks, planes and ships that would be needed to fight smaller scale wars.\n\nThat means the news that came out today, in a short news release, should please the generals and admirals concerned, since some of the money that had been earmarked to the construction of reactors or the funding on nuclear research "that had few benefits at this current time" had instead been diverted to several "promising conventional weapons systems to keep our military strong."\n\nWhile the NNC is still ongoing, and will be going on for a while to come, some money that was to go toward the planning and designing of reactors and programs that had not yet started construction will instead be held back and moved to defense procurement projects. Those reactors and facilities under construction will continue their progress, but newer ones will be slowed down in the future.\n\nThe mood in the Pentagon is much calmer and more relaxed since the news came out, as it's clear that the President was not going to turn his back on the men and women that are defending America in a tumultuous world. The knowledge that the Commander-in-Chief is supporting them has improved morale amongst all ranks, from private to General, and that he will prioritize the defense of America over everything else."

Telegrams and letters were pouring in, and frantic and frazzled officials were doing their best to read them and summarize contents. In general: President Glenn's proposed spending bill, the Augmented Defense Act of [GetYear] to give the military more money was not well received.\n\nCongressmen were rallying against the President on the floor of Congress, while Senators were demanding face to face meetings to voice their displeasure. The few hawks in Congress were nearly totally sidelined, as Democrats, C-NPP and other enemies are working together to try to reign in a President that seemed to be out of control.\n\n"The President is asking the taxpayer to continue throwing their hard-earned dollars into the bottomless pit that is his vanity projects. Space exploration to distant planets, nuclear reactors for every home, and now asking us to give Cadillacs to every soldier!" one congressperson bellowed on the floor of the House. "How will we pay for this? The Taxpayer is already bled dry. We already borrow way more than we should. We can print the money, but that will lead to hyperinflation. So the only answer is to stop!"\n\n"I'm all for giving our soldiers the means to protect America, and I'm in favor of building our nation's infrastructure, and to advance the frontiers of knowledge." a Pro-Glenn Representative said in an op-ed in the New York Times. "But eventually, you have to be pragmatic and realistic. We cannot afford to bankrupt the nation to do it."\n\nPolls are already showing the President's approval is faltering, and the ever delicate coalition of Republican and Democrats is fraying at the seams.

To pass the bill, there were pork barrel projects galore shoved in to appeal to certain members of congress. After all, who would vote against a massively bloated budget bill if that bill happened to have the money for a new bridge, or hospital, or highway for their district? The Republicans in Congress seem to have no restraint, gladly shoveling billions of dollars into everything that the President wants and needs. Democrats are bolting the party, and the President's approval rating across the nation is cratering. The NPP is taking advantage, harping on how the President's spending is going to tank the economy, building big and ridiculous monuments to his ego like the dictators of Europe.\n\nAt the end of the day, with favorability ratings dropping, the debt skyrocketing, and politicians of all stripes gunning for him, President Glenn can at least take some satisfaction in knowing that at least the military really appreciates the support and funding."

glenn.86.t:0 "The Augmented Defense Act Fails!"
glenn.86.desc:0 "Looking back on it now, it seemed inevitable. There was just too much opposition, from the voters and Congress for the Augmented Defense Act to even have a chance in Congress. Filibusters in the Senate stretched on for days, as first one senator, then another, and another took their turns at the podium, refusing to stand down, and instead keep talking. Even some of the President's staunchest supporters, more concerned with holding their seats in the next election, either abstained or voted against the law.\n\nBut for all the support for the rest of President Glenn's ambitious agenda that got him elected, even this was too far. Billions of dollars has been spent on NASA, the National Nuclear Commission, and all the other programs and projects he favored already, and the will to spend more is just not there. The fear of higher taxes, more debt, and more red ink on the books is too much.\n\nThe biggest casualty for the President though is his standing amongst the troops. The failure of the bill has already sent shockwaves through the military establishment. How can America defend itself from new Nazi planes? Or cutting edge Japanese ships? How does the United States plan on winning the next war without it going nuclear? The anger is focused on the President, and not the penny-pinching Congress though. It's Glenn's fault, for focusing his time and effort on his nuclear power plants and bombers, and not on the needs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He promised so much to the troops, to get them better equipment, training and housing. And yet, he failed."

While economists have welcomed the non-interference by the federal government in the commodities markets, political analysts have warned that the difference will be reflected in increased budget figures, necessitating higher tax rates even as the Glenn administration continues to struggle to explain its fiscal policies to Congress.\n\nNPP leaders were quick to react to the news, with leadership figures commenting that "For all the R-D's talk about being the party of responsible governance, the dollar figures being spent by the Glenn administration are nothing short of alarming, especially when they are being spent on unproven, untested boondoggles.""

The federal government would have its way, with the authority to organize and manage the production of uranium across the United States, an expansion of national security powers not seen since the end of the Second World War.\n\nThe business press, naturally, had cried foul. The Wall Street Journal's editorial page carried a feverish warning from their board: "EXPANSION OF PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY THE LATEST SURRENDER OF AMERICAN FREEDOMS."\n\n"Second-best headline they've ever come up with, after 'Glenn Wins Presidency,'" Glenn remarked.\n\n"Still can't quite believe we pulled it off." Treasury Secretary Javits was all smiles, a rarity given his precarious portfolio only months ago. "Now the mining companies will have to fall in line. They might try to stonewall us, but with the force of the law on our side..."\n\nGlenn laughed easily as he handed Javits the latest polling results from Gallup - a solid five point increase.

The seizure of the uranium mines, they had found, had no sound legal basis - that the seizure of private enterprise for state use was the first step away from freedom and towards tyranny.\n\n"The only freedom the Court protected today was the freedom of monopolists to defraud the government," Glenn remarked sourly. The mining companies had wasted little time presenting new uranium contracts to the administration after their legal victory - and the bill had risen threefold.\n\nVice-President Gore rubbed his eyes, sunken in their sockets after days of preparing for the Supreme Court hearings. "I wish that were the end of the bad news, but Gallup's got the latest polling surveys for us." He handed a sheaf of papers to Glenn, whose face darkened as he flipped through the data.\n\n"Public lacks confidence in the administration's ability to execute policy, economists express concern over fiscal deterioration, experts troubled by inability of the Justice Department to win disputes..." Glenn read the summary incredulously before tossing the papers in the trash. "Sometimes, I think we really do overestimate the intelligence of the average voter in America.""

Build up our own nuclear arsenal, and sabotage those of our rivals.\n\nThat didn't mean it was a good plan.\n\nIt is clear now that the administration was too optimistic on how it would play it. The phones in the West Wing were ringing with an intensity that one would expect them to burst into flame at any moment. Officials of various ranks hurried from meeting to meeting to assure everyone that, while yes, things were clearly tense now, the administration is working tirelessly to ensure America's safety. And tirelessly they worked, paddling hard to stay afloat. But it wasn't like the graceful paddling of a swan, it was more akin to the panicked flopping of a fish who had just been thrown onto dry land.\n\nIt was certainly how President Glenn felt, sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office. The worst of the crisis had passed, fortunately. Despite everything, he was still sitting behind his desk, instead of in an underground room in the Pentagon. So in a way, there was progress: no nuclear exchange today.\n\nWhich meant the aftermath had to be considered.\n\nBefore Glenn's desk stood one of the many suits of the State Department. Across the world, so the diplomat told the president, USA embassies were flooded with inquiries about what the hell had happened and why. And so the official asked Glenn:\n\n"Mr President, what should we tell them?""

glenn.100.desc:0 "The executive order laid before President Glenn on his desk in the Oval Office, awaiting his signature: dismantling the various nuclear build-up programs. The administration had tried, optimistically perhaps, to force nuclear disarmament from a position of strength. Achieve strategic supremacy, and from that position enforce global disarmament. By now, after everything that had happened, the strategy became once again what it once was: an idea, and an impossible one at that. Tensions were high, very high, both internationally and domestically.\n\nLooking back on how it had backfired, Glenn thought of himself like a gambler in a game of poker, revealing his cards only to to see his opponent had a Royal Flush all along. Perhaps the truth of the matter was nothing so dramatic: no miscalculations from the start, but simple bad luck. Or perhaps the president's strategy had been predestined to fail, being built on shaky foundations. Or perhaps the idea was sound, but executed poorly. It hardly mattered now, and these questions were nothing but food for thought for future historians.\n\nWith a few swift strokes of his pen, the deed was done. America's programs to expand its strategic nuclear arsenal as President Glenn envisioned, came to an end. And with the closing of this chapter, a new chapter opened. It was a chapter Glenn was not looking forward to:\n\nFixing the mess."

President Glenn sat and listened patiently, before explaining his own position, and politely reminding his guest that he had other engagements to attend to, especially in such a time of crisis. It had been the third time the president had used this routine this day.\n\nAll these congressmen and senators coming to voice their concerns over the administration's foreign policy. Glenn was playing a dangerous game. Glenn was risking nuclear annihilation. Glenn learned nothing from the recent crisis.\n\nGlenn had heard it all by now.\n\nYet, the president had to entertain some of them in the Oval Office, if only to show his own party that he took their concerns seriously. He understood very well, after all, his administration had considered a more dovish response when the recent crisis threw the White House in chaos. Now he had dozens of his own party demand he'd tone down.\n\nPresident Glenn would listen and patiently explain why he believed this course was the best course of action. We have to stick by what we believe, and not allow our love of peace to turn into a fear of action. Some listened, a few were persuaded. But, at the end of the day, it became clear to the president that, politically at least, his policy carried a heavy cost. The divides within our party grow larger."

Sure, there were still constant phone calls, interns and aides scurrying about from office to office, or angry senators demanding one-on-one time with the president. Yet, it was slightly less than yesterday. And yesterday it was slightly less than the day before. Gradually, the realization dawned that the administration was returning to normal operating protocols. Whereas a week ago the White House was still at a proverbial code red, right now, that code had shifted to a slightly less pronounced hue: orange, perhaps?\n\nAfter weeks of damage control and crisis management overworked officials could finally breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that at last they could get a good night's sleep for once. The president too, after crisis cabinet meeting after another, slowly returned to the old peacetime day-to-day rhythm of the presidency, sinking back in the relative comfort of the routine of government.\n\nThe public won't soon forget everything that happened. We have been close to the brink, closer than we had been in a long time. But now is not the time to rest. Every statesman knows politics is just going from one crisis to another, with various periods of relative calm in between. This crisis has been weathered, but we must be ready when the next one strikes. Perhaps more importantly, with this return to normalcy, it is time we start governing again.\n\nGlenn has a country to run."

Three of our uranium mines in mainland China suffered substantial damage, and we have no trace of any perpetrator. The criminals fled the scene before the local police were activated. What's more is that another uranium mine in China was utterly destroyed, killing several workers who were present. One convoy carrying uranium from China to a port on our island was also sabotaged.\n\nThe only clue we have right now is that all sabotage attempts happened within minutes of the last; clearly, the acts are connected. We suspect that growing unrest in our Chinese population is to blame, but we will conduct further investigation into the suspicious activity. While our uranium supply can be regenerated, admittedly, the effort will take some time. As we speak, our workers are already beginning to repair the damaged uranium mines, but it will take some time before our nuclear arsenal is back at full strength."

Unfortunately, the saboteurs made their escape before the local police could arrive at the scene. However, seeing as the attacks happened within minutes of each other, it is safe to assume that the attacks are connected.\n\nOur diplomats have been surveying a number of strange events happening to uranium mines across the globe. Accidents have been reported at numerous uranium sites, and trade routes involving the shipment of uranium have been temporarily shut down. No events like these were reported in our sphere until this morning, when our own uranium sources were abruptly hijacked. Overall, it appears as though the amount of uranium circulating is starting to decrease; this news comes at a bad time as our nuclear arsenal requires more maintenance than ever before.\n\nOur top military advisers urge us to conduct more investigations into the crimes committed this morning and apprehend the perpetrators who are responsible. However, this action could get in the way of our repair; though it will take some time, our uranium supply can be regained. We could also choose to ignore the sabotage attempts and focus on the rebuilding process."

The investigation into the bombing showed that this incident was no accident; several infiltrators blew up the mine remotely. Our top domestic investigators have done all they can to find a likely suspect, but our research bears no fruit. Top politicians and leaders are furious about the lack of evidence, and our reputation on the world stage is currently under attack. Some foreign officials have started to believe that we do not have full control over our country. We have to bring these malicious vandals to justice as soon as possible.\n\nFor the time being, as our uranium supply took a big hit, our nuclear stockpile must be compromised. It is a tough decision to make, but perhaps we can invest in other military resources while we wait for domestic intelligence to complete their task. Our police force has been notified and police activity surrounding our working mines has been ramped up significantly.\n\nWe need to keep a more watchful eye on our remaining supply to ensure that there will be no further sabotage on our nuclear arsenal."

Late last night, the group of Americans were just about to begin another attack against our western mine when several officers caught them in the act, knocked them unconscious, and sent them to the investigators for their identities to be determined.\n\n'This was a severe diplomatic mistake made by the American government, and we will make sure they pay for their international crime,' one domestic official claimed when he first heard the news.\n\nTwenty of our workers were killed in the attacks on our mines, and another hundred were severely injured. 'The Americans are not only committing a senseless crime, but this may very well be an act of war against our people,' another officer stated in an interview with our station.\n\nWe will continue to update the situation as soon as we get more information regarding the American invaders"

Even the Japanese officers were aware of the significance of 4:00AM, but they could never stop the attacks on their supply in time, and with enough resources preserved. The saboteurs carried out their operations with such mystery and perfection. Within minutes, a cargo ship suffers plenty of damage, its uranium resources thrown abruptly into the sea.\n\nA number of these incidents has happened across China during the last week, and Japanese officials always fail to capture the criminals responsible, and thus their identities are lost with the passing of time. However, one specific incident that took place in Hokkaido truly grabbed the eyes of our officials.\n\nAn unprotected cargo ship was suddenly and utterly destroyed, its crew of twenty-two sailors and passengers burning alive as the dead ship plunged to the bottom of the ocean. Neither the abundant uranium resources nor any member of the ship's crew were ever recovered. This lone attack on our ship cripples our uranium supply and the production of our nuclear weapons has come to a standstill for the time being.

The national police force has been notified and it is also monitoring the situation at home, keeping a close eye on the usual Chinese dissidents.\n\nWe have been working hard to ensure that these acts of sabotage do not happen within our empirical borders, but these rebels have proven to be highly organized.

The previous wave of workers had just returned from the grueling night, one filled with rain amidst the heavy German shouting. Their feet trudged along as not one uttered a word. These husks of men and boys appeared as though they left their own souls back at the mine. Business as usual. "Sklaven," the headmaster yelled, "move out!"\n\nAnd so another day began for the slaves. Boys as young as seven and men as old as sixty performed equally deadly tasks, though the most conditioned men were the ones to handle the raw uranium. It was difficult work, but at least every man had some sort of reason to keep living.\n\nSuddenly, the crashing sound of Herr Rüdiger's voice rang in everyone's ears. A poor boy of twelve stood before the master and admitted what each worker had already discovered. "Th-there's no more uranium here! Not for any of us!"\n\nThe old master huffed and curled his fists, ready to tear the young boy into a mess of blood and flesh, when a telephone rang. Rüdiger picked up the telephone and listened intently, and his eyes widened. "One of our mines in Russia came up empty all of a sudden! We've been checking all of our mines for more damage. How's yours looking, Herr Rüdiger?"\n\nThe old man dropped the phone and stared in disbelief. He looked at the mine himself and saw nothing. He panicked; he had a quota to deliver!

Our leaders are growing ever more impatient with our handling of the crisis, and if we don't find the saboteurs soon, it's off with our heads.\n\nAnd this is a big deal. Our entire nuclear arsenal is at stake here. We refuse to let the Japanese and Americans overtake us in this field. A few German investigators are considering the possibility of a Japanese spy or an American infiltrator as the cause behind the uranium raid, but there has been no confirmation. The criminals could very well be a handful of slaves who gained "independent thought" the night before and decided to test their luck on a successful raid. Simply put, we can't gather enough evidence to make a definite conclusion.\n\nThe good news is, we can rebuild our uranium supply. Our nuclear arsenal will grow back in due time. We now have the choice to either continue the investigation in hopes of finding an important clue, or we can set the matter away and focus on other issues.

It is a hard decision, but I must confess to my wrongful actions in hopes that I will receive forgiveness not just from the Japanese, but from my own country..."\n\nThese were the words uttered by President Glenn in a press conference released yesterday morning. Many high-ranking politicians can't get enough of Glenn's sincere apology; they have been watching playbacks of the conference, waiting for the moment where the crowd of Americans turns silent almost instantly. There is no doubt that the American spirit has been crushed by our discoveries.\n\nOur quick involvement has cut a deep scar into the American reputation, but we can always go deeper. President Glenn presented his speech in such a way that anyone could tell how deeply regretful and sorry he was.

He began to request heavy American compensation for the attack on German uranium mines; the President would have until tomorrow to respond with an answer. As soon as the Foreign Minister hung up, Glenn started to consider his current options.

The public would condemn him even more if he tried to accept the cost of his failed actions in Germany. However, if he decided to pay, this would finally put him at peace with the superpower. Glenn also noticed an opportunity to glue the shards of the American spirit back together; he could stand firm and deny the reparations, and he would have the strength of the public on his side. But this action would cause Germany to be even more aggressive. Glenn had one important decision to make."

The rocket then slowly tumbled back to Earth, ultimately crashing some miles from the launch site. Thankfully there was no one in the area where it landed. Despite a lack of casualties, this failure still represents millions of dollars now lost to the project.\n\nThe failure has hit the team hard. Seeing months of work go up in smoke has left overall morale low. Currently, our engineers are pouring over the figures to try and determine what went wrong, looking for what we did not prepare for. We can only hope to use what we have learned here to try and improve our next missions and prevent another disaster.\n\nAs expected, the public is not happy.

However, what we have seen is an exponential increase, rivaling even the military budget. There is some criticism that these funds are being mishandled, and represent a drain on the economy. Now, if you take a look at this graph here, you can clearly see...."\n\nMr.President, it appears that Congress has decided to cut some of our funding. Many Congressmen have noticed our waning public support and felt that our budget is better used elsewhere. The cut was passed this morning, with moderate support. Sadly, now we need to start looking at what projects we can afford to postpone.\n\nIf we want to maintain NASA's current budget, we need to work on the public's approval.

The Melas Chasma had a quiet beauty to it, a landscape of deep grooves and red sand. "We're really here aren't we?" Cross posed, not moving his hands a inch from his control panel."We really are." Armstrong affirmed his grip on the joystick, and took them in.\n\nNeil Armstrong descended from the lander, and became the first human to step foot onto a new world."From our earliest days mankind has looked up and dreamed of walking amongst the stars, today, that dream has been fulfilled." After this, the streets had erupted into beautiful chaos. Traffic halted as people crowded the roads. Firework detonations had become near constant. The Moon landing had ensured America's spot within the space race. Landing on Mars, had reinvigorated the American spirit. The future was finally looking bright.\n\nFrom within NASA's mission control, John Glenn stood. Cheers erupted as the landing was confirmed.

The President, on the other hand, wished he was one of them. John Glenn was all too aware of why the agent from the Government Accountability Office sat across the Resolute Desk, leather suitcase and hat neatly resting on crossed legs in a pinstriped suit. The dead eyed, almost uninterested stare of the pale man, who had only introduced himself as "Agent Anderson of the GAO," rested on the President's face as Glenn struggled to not squirm in his chair.\n\n"I was surprised to learn of your request for a meeting at this hour," Glenn said in as neutral of a tone he could manage, "why not just have Elmer drop by tomorrow?"\n\nThe agent's fingers drummed lightly on his suitcase. "Mr. Staats was worried about the... speculations an unscheduled visit by the Comptroller General to the White House could fuel in Congress. Rest assured that the CG has nothing but the best interest of the President and the Nation at heart. Yet..."\n\nThe agent's eyes fixed on Glenn's, and all of a sudden the President felt like a deer staring at a wolf. "Sometimes, Mr. President, those things... may not overlap as thoroughly as they should. Which brings me to the purpose of my presence here. Last week the Comptroller General's office received a concerned phone call from the Pentagon. It would appear the Air Force's annual budget does not seem to totally align with the budget Congress passed last year. There may have been... misappropriations in the direction of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. About $840 million, to be exact. I spoke with Undersecretary McLucas, the one who last reviewed the budget, and he showed that he had noted the irregularity at the time and logged it with the West Wing.

A shame he wouldn't give up whoever's been messing with the budgets. I noticed you'd also tried to prod the cabbies. Any luck?"\n\nThe nondescript agent in the pinstripe suit nodded, his thoughts seemingly elsewhere. "Yes, Sir, a full list is on page 13 of my report.

Beating a silent retreat to the Residence, Glenn found himself apprehensive and fearful as the product of the meeting was brought to him minutes later. It was lucky that the Comptroller General had a fondness for demanding copies to be made of all GAO reports, and even luckier that Rosalind Voynich, the secretary usually copying said reports, had formerly worked for the Secretary of State as his personal secretary, remaining close family friends.

His boss, Robert Seamans, normally a quiet academic type, had gotten increasingly nervous and forgetful, and left notes asking him to go on curious errands to various parts with suitcases and sealed notes exchanging hands.

The "NASA Papers" proved the Under Secretary of the Air Force, John McLucas, who had been implementing the congressionally mandated military budget while SecAir Seamans was off work sick, had accidentally made a calculation error, then later panicked and tried to hide his mistake. Some papers even hinted he may have bribed secretaries at the Pentagon to destroy papers. Needless to say, the political careers of both Seamans and McLucas were over, though the former would find himself back at MIT, avoiding the internal executive and soon to come congressional investigation into McLucas.

Perhaps it was the rapid expansion of the American nuclear stockpile over the years that inspired the other powers to come to the table. But one way or another, the wheels are now in motion for a first-of-its-kind disarmament treaty.\n\nThe results of these negotiations remain to be seen, but many are hopeful that this will be the first meaningful step towards world peace."

At least they can all rest assured that as the largest nuclear power, we have the most to sacrifice at these talks. There are two main options for an opening argument to sell the former Axis on disarmament.\n\nThe first argument is one of pure pragmatism: Our nuclear stockpiles are putting all of us in the red. If we all agree we don't want to launch first strikes, then cutting the costs of our atomic arsenals should be a no brainer. This argument will prioritize cutting spending on ABM systems and limiting our ICBM stockpiles. This is a more realistic goal, and will preserve our advantage in the missile gap, but will only achieve very limited spending reductions and disarmament.\n\nThe second is more moral and idealistic: We tell the nations point blank that we cannot let a war between the nations end the human race. We're on the brink of destruction and we all need to step the hell back for the good of mankind. This will lead to massive disarmament and equally massive savings....if it works. If not, we may well walk away with nothing. Japan is particularly afraid of us launching an invasion if there is no nuclear deterrent to stop us.\n\nOf course, both options shall allow for opportunities to compromise. Which shall we choose?"

He tells us that Cold War intrigue has put all humanity at risk, and that we need a radical revision of our nuclear strategies to prevent a global catastrophe. If we don't beat our swords to plowshares now, we may one day see our children perish in an nuclear conflagration.\n\nWhile this tall order may be a form of anchoring we can haggle him down from, it sets a highly optimistic tone for the proceedings. The offer is shocking, but tantalizing. We could save a fortune if we disarm, and it will put us on even footing with the United States. On the other hand, we could lose the one thing that keeps OFN troops from attacking our soil.\n\nHowever, this is an offer, not an ultimatum.

He tells us that the race to close the missile gap is an unbearable financial strain on all its participants. We could all devote more funding to our societal development if we reduced our missile stockpiles and stopped funding ABM technologies.\n\nWhile this is only a modest proposal, there are some strong drawbacks. If all of us equally downsize, the US will still outmatch us in the missile gap. Moreover, eliminating ABM research will provide us no deterrent against their massive arsenal. We could be selling long term victory for short term savings.\n\nHowever, this is an offer, not an ultimatum.

glenn.nuclear.100.desc:0 "Anti-ballistic missiles are surface-to-air missiles designed to intercept and destroy incoming nuclear warheads before they can hit their targets. They could potentially render nuclear missiles obsolete, but their operating costs are extraordinary. It's estimated that for every $1 the enemy spends on nuclear offense, we would have to spend $20 on nuclear defense. The Zeus, Spartan, and Sentinel ABM programs have already cost us a fortune, and emerging technologies like MIRVs threaten to exponentially increase costs. The Germans and Japanese are spending a lot of money on these too, but if we can convince everyone to throw in the towel on ABM's then we could divert a dragon's horde worth of funding to the NASA budget.\n\nWe have two options: Either we could propose an outright ban on ABM systems or we could propose a compromise agreement to limit their numbers. The first option involves pitching to the Germans and Japanese that ABMs are simply too expensive for what little benefit they bring. Signing an ABM ban could instantly result in massive savings, but concerns about rising nuclear powers such as India and Italy could make the deal unpalatable to the former Axis. We may be better off simply proposing a compromise to limit ABM stockpiles, as this would almost certainly be signed. Yet, we would also still be spending a significant amount of money on ABMs under this proposal.\n\nWhat shall we propose?"

Citing their exponentially increasing costs and limited practical utility, Glenn says that we have no realistic choice but to nip ABM technology in the bud before it bankrupts us all.\n\nHe's right, of course. Every one of our economists agrees that our ABM program is a fiscal nightmare. At the same time, our generals and admirals are alarmed by this extreme proposal. They point out that concerning reports of the Delhi regime's "Smiling Buddha" program suggest they could soon become a nuclear power. If we have no ABM infrastructure in place at all, Tokyo will be utterly defenseless in the event of a nuclear attack by India. They urge us to consider accepting only limited ABM reductions, leaving intact our infrastructure near the Indian border.\n\nAn Indian first strike is an extremely hypothetical scenario, but the nationalists may just be crazy enough to do it if they get their say. Shall we accept Glenn's terms or protest?"

If any of these Hindutva types get their way, there's no telling how far they'll go to realize their dream of "Akhand Bharat" , and this "Smiling Buddha" project our intelligence agency keeps worrying about may just be the key to do so.\n\nStill, maybe Germany will back us up on this one?

However, this report has sent the militarists into a tizzy. They state that the Italians are almost certainly on the verge of a breakthrough with their "Alfa" program and will soon have dozens of warheads pointed at Berlin. Dismantling our ABM infrastructure, they insist, will be tantamount to sacrificing the lives of the entire German people and constitute treason against the Reich.\n\nWe could probably wrangle them into a compromise to retain our ABM infrastructure at the Italian border, but there's no way we could get behind Glenn's entire proposal without putting our government in jeopardy. A damn shame too, because we desperately need to cut our military budget. We have no choice but to back Japan's demands for a compromise on ABM's."

Their negotiators state that, like Japan, they have concerns about a rising nuclear power on their own borders. They are open to a compromise to reduce their ABM infrastructure, but insist on retaining a limited ABM stockpile to use against Italy in the event of an attack. We think the idea of Italy invading Germany is absurd, but perhaps the Nazi military-industrial complex still holds sway over the Fuhrer's actions.\n\nRegardless, it's clear this proposal is dead in the water unless we agree to their compromises. It's not the end of the world, we'll still be limiting ABMs, but the savings will be much less than we'd hoped."

Thankfully, we will at least be able to achieve some financial breathing room with this compromise, but it was far less than what we desired. Worse yet, we now appear to have lost face by backing down from our initial proposal, and this may make it harder to sell the powers on ICBM and SLBM reductions as well. Nevertheless, the talks have already resulted in one deal being signed, let's hope for more."
glenn.nuclear.105.desc2:0 "Our clever negotiation strategy has swiftly resulted in a compromise on ABMs. They may be expensive, but prohibiting them entirely was never a realistic option.

They are the most important component of the nuclear triad, and modern ICBMs are able to annihilate any city on Earth within 30 minutes. They are what General Hap Arnold warned us about when he said, back in 1943, that "Someday, not too distant, there can come streaking out of somewhere – we won't be able to hear it, it will come so fast – some kind of gadget with an explosive so powerful that one projectile will be able to wipe out completely this city of Washington." They must be limited if we are to save the money NASA needs, but the former Axis won't part with them easily.\n\nOur investigators have come up with two proposals for an ICBM deal: Agreeing to scrap a certain number of ICBMs, or a proposal to convert some of them to cheaper SLBMs. Scrapping them is the most cost-effective measure, and is a clean-cut and simple solution to the ICBM arms race. On the other hand, the powers might balk at large scale disarmament and refuse outright if compromises aren't made. The SLBM compromise stands a better chance of passing, yet we won't be able to save as much money as we would on pure disarmament. Which shall it be?"

The Kriegsmarine has always been an afterthought for Germany ever since the failure of the Hochseeflotte, and they have never had the shipbuilding capacity to maintain a substantial submarine fleet. When faced with an impossible proposal, Germany will have to decline. So we would be wise to bear this in mind when it comes to the ratio of ICBMs to be converted. What shall we propose?"

This would prevent the construction of new nuclear weapons in order to lock our arsenals into whatever state they are after the limitation treaty is signed. This would end the arms race and be a great boon to us, yet it reminds us to be cautious about the conversion ratio we propose. What ratio shall we suggest?"

While they are not entirely sure why Burgundy would want to sabotage the disarmament talks, they suspect that Burgundy has staged a false-flag attack to damage Germany's international reputation and sow chaos within the German government in anticipation of a second Himmlerite Putsch.\n\nThese claims about Burgundy smack of a conspiracy theory, one which has little evidence other than the Nazis' word. Yet, it is also unclear why Germany would want to assassinate the President. The fact that the three powers have reached an initial agreement would suggest Germany is interested in disarmament, and doesn't it seem crazier that Germany would agree to a partial disarmament then assassinate the President of the United States than that Himmler would try to sabotage these talks?\n\nThe choice is yours, Mr. President.

No one on our team reports feeling targeted.

While no one has officially been blamed for the attack yet, inside sources speaking on condition of anonymity are suggesting that intense intelligence scrutiny is currently being placed on the Burgundian Order State. In any case, it appears that peace has prevailed through terrible adversity."

USA_23_59_desc:0 "We overplayed our hand... badly. We have been on the brink of war and suffered humiliation. Our administration has lost the faith of our allies in the OFN and of our own people. Right now, we are in damage control mode, and the clock is very close to midnight. Emergency meetings have to be scheduled, ambassadors reassured, and most importantly: we have to find a way out of this mess we created."
USA_discontinue_buildup_programs_desc:0 "The recent crisis has redefined our administration's priorities. Our strategy of enforcing nuclear disarmament through strategic nuclear dominance has clearly failed. Our buildup programs are now nothing but extremely expensive dead-weights which serve no purpose but the satisfaction of the egos of generals. Whatever course we take in the future, it is clear that our first priority needs to be ending these expensive and useless programs."
USA_bet_on_dove_desc:0 "When you see the Earth from space you realise how fragile this tiny blue dot of ours is. President Glenn has seen it and he has seen the threat of nuclear annihilation. But the president is a man of peace, fortunately. De-escalation is to be more than an occasional gimmick, it is to be our policy! Even if our allies in the OFN might not like it, we must reassure the American public that President Glenn will not be the one to pull the trigger."
USA_reassess_oceanian_commitments_desc:0 "For a long time now the United States has maintained a sizable contingent of troops in Australia and New Zealand. If we want to assure the American public that we take our policy of peace seriously, it is time we reconsider the scope of our presence in the region. Perhaps it is time to bring some of our boys back home. Our allies in the OFN are unlikely to appreciate this, as it will compromise the effectiveness of ANZAC, but there are greater things at stake here. By reducing our troop presence in the region we will send a clear signal to the American public, and the world, that we are here not to make war, but to make peace."
USA_rebuke_jingoists_desc:0 "If this crisis has shown us anything it is the danger of Hawkish foreign policy. The unrepentant warmongers of the NPP meanwhile, seem blissfully ignorant of reality. Even now, they call for ever more brazen provocations and pushing the doomsday clock ever closer to midnight. If they would have their way, we would be marching even closer to armageddon with their firebrand rhetoric. We must challenge them wherever we can: in Congress, on television, on the airwaves, in the newspapers. President Glenn will take a stand and expose them for what they are: trigger-happy madman who should never be allowed within a hundred mile radius of the nuclear launch codes."
USA_peaceful_party_desc:0 "Our party has long earned the faith of the American people by being the more sensible alternative to the NPP's hardline warmongering. Let us remind the public that we are still the party of peace! President Glenn has shown that he can navigate a crisis and de-escalate tensions. While this affair was unfortunate, it nevertheless affirms what we already know: that ultimately, our party is the party of peace. Under President Glenn, we will keep war off our shores."
USA_23_55_desc:0 "It seems the worst is over now. We have weathered the storm and emerged on the other side, battered, but not yet broken. The clock has been set back by a few minutes. While this recent crisis will be etched in America's collective consciousness for many decades to come, the demands of running a nation do not wait up for anyone. For now, we have to get back to the work of governing. Legislation must be considered, bills amended, appointments finalized. We will leave it to future historians to reflect on what has happened.\n\nAmerica doesn't run itself after all."
USA_maintain_commitments_desc:0 "The popularity polls be damned, America keeps its promises. We must show our allies in the Organization of Free Nation that we are not fair-weather friends or mere summer patriots. It is in times like these that we show what we are truly made of and what we truly stand for. As such, we will not back down on our promises to our friends. Should the worst come to pass, we will be there with them, as we have been in the past."
USA_reassure_allies_desc:0 "Our support to our allies must be unambiguous, especially in times like these. Our friends in ANZAC must be assured that we're with them every step in the way. Therefore, we will publicly reaffirm the policy of the United States, that any attack on them is to be regarded as an attack on America itself. If Japan tries its hand, we will be there to counter it. Such a declaration will be deeply unpopular with many civilians, who long for nothing more than peace at home. But we cannot allow the fire of freedom to go extinguished in Oceania."
USA_drump_up_enthusiaism_desc:0 "We have avoided the worst, and though we have come dangerously close to the edge of the abyss, the Union is still strong! We must remain on our guard, remain vigilant, and maintain absolute readiness to be ready to defend freedom! Let us salute the stars and stripes as we always have and be unwavering in our willingness to fight for Uncle Sam. President Glenn will remind the American public that we cannot yet shirk our duties in defence against fascism. Every good soldier boy from sea to shining sea will know that America is still with them!"
USA_united_in_freedom_desc:0 "Let us be clear, there is no argument between peace and war. But peace found in submission to fascism is never an option! The USA is committed is as committed as ever to the global cause of liberty and freedom, come high or low tide. Our allies in the Organization of Free Nations know this, and these bonds that bind us together in the shade of the tree of liberty are still strong and unbroken. Despots, tyrants, and fascists are still out there. But the United States and the OFN will hold the line against the tide, as we always have, and as we always will."
