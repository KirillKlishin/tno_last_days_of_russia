 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 SAM_ANDREY_VLASOV_DESC:0 "Само имя Андрея Андреевича Власова, генерала-перебежчика Красной Армии, остается деликатной темой для многих россиян. Для его немногих сторонников Власов - современный Иван Калита, дальновидный правитель, который мудро подчинился военному превосходству завоевателя, а затем воспользовался их покровительством, чтобы закрепиться в будущем за могущественным и независимым российским государством. Однако для большинства бывших советских граждан его имя ассоциируется с самым чудовищным предательством, сравнимым с именем Иуды. Конечно, настоящий характер Власова гораздо менее поэтичен.\n\n Трудно сказать, движет ли опальный генерал искренним желанием проткнуть красную угрозу немецкими штыками или простым стремлением выжить, когда он объединился с нацистами; но какими бы ни были его мотивы, немецкое верховенство никогда не считало его достойным внимания союзником, лишь позволяя ему молча смотреть на то, как его страну топчут под немецким сапогом со стороны далеко за линией фронта. \n\n Последний шанс для Власова искупить вину как в глазах немцев, так и в глазах русского народа появился во время Западно-Российской войны, когда его русская освободительная армия помогла переломить ход борьбы против наступления Западно-Российского революционного фронта. Несмотря на то, что именно Власов помог отбить Советов, получив после этого собственные владения в Самаре, немцы все равно видели в нем чуть больше, чем собаку, которую нужно было держать на короткой цепочке и пристально наблюдать. Униженный своими хозяевами и непопулярный среди некогда заслуживавших доверия офицеров, которые стали рассматривать его рабское поведение как препятствие на пути освобождения России, Власов остается слабой и изолированной фигурой, которая может только надеяться, что возвращение России снимет с него жалкий титул отвратительного предателя."

 SAM_MILETIY_ZYKOV_DESC:0 "Не будет преувеличением сказать, что Милетий Александрович Зыков был сердцем и совестью Русского освободительного движения - если назвать "движением" такое рассеянное собрание власовских генералов и гражданских деятелей, собранное под эгидой фашистских захватчиков. Признанный за свой пропагандистский талант, Зыков был человеком, формировавшим идеологию Российской освободительной армии и выдвинувшим демократические идеалы, оказавшиеся столь важными в борьбе против советской тирании. Даже если эти идеалы были омрачены потребностями войны, Зыков последовательно поддерживал обновленную российскую демократию и придавал столь необходимую легитимность обреченному на провал делу служения как оккупантам, так и оккупантам.\n\n Прошлое и истинные мотивы Зыкова остаются неразрешимой загадкой даже для его коллег. Его противоречивые, зачастую бессмысленные комментарии о себе лишь еще больше расширяют паутину слухов, окутавших его биографию. Утверждая, что он бывший адъютант Николая Бухарина и сторонник марксистской мысли, Зыков предпочитает представить себя адептом российского республиканизма, увидевшим неизбежный провал большевизма. Между тем его многочисленные оппоненты в КОНР изображают Зыкова нечестным оппортунистом, смиренно большевистским еврейским писателем, который перешел в РОА только ради спасения своей шкуры и с тех пор воспользовался популистской притягательностью и идеалистическим фасадом для расширения своего личного влияния.\n\n Будучи одним из ближайших людей к Андрею Власову и одним из его самых ярых сторонников, Зыков добился благосклонности старого генерала к собственной заявке на власть в РОА после смерти Власова. Всякий раз, когда его убеждения лгут, ему приходится испытывать их между молотом старой гвардии, сопротивляющейся его мятежной риторике, и наковальней его доли и бремени как предателя."

 SAM_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_DESC:0 "Лишь немногие мужчины внесли такой же вклад в успех русской освободительной армии, как Сергей Кузьмич Буняченко. Солдат Красной Армии с 16 лет, он видел бои на большем количестве фронтов и сражений, чем большинство, как в Гражданской войне России, так и во Второй мировой войне. Он был бы ведущим командующим на Кавказе, но столкнулся бы с трудностями в переломе войны. Вернувшись домой, режим Бухарина нашел его идеальным козлом отпущения, на которого можно было бы возложить вину за неудачи Красной Армии, даже если бы он не был тем, кто виноват в полной неспособности Советского Союза защититься. Однако вскоре, во время храброго контратаки, его дивизия будет окружена, и он будет захвачен в плен.\n\n Буняченко останется в исправительной колонии, отделенной от общества, до печально известной западно-русской войны. Именно тогда он попросил бы у правительства, от которого он был во власти, присоединиться к борьбе против ЗРРФ и отомстить коммунистам, к которым он питал столько ненависти. Он храбро сражался на стороне Власова и Русской освободительной армии, пока РОА не объединилась в собственное милитаристское государство в Самаре. Там он будет играть ключевую роль в управлении регионом и воспитании полноценной армии. Это в конечном итоге заработало бы ему высокую должность в правительстве, став министром обороны.\n\n Со смертью Власова Буняченко сумел подняться к власти в Самаре. Милитарист Буняченко не остановится до тех пор, пока не разберется с коммунистами и, возможно, немцами и на Западе. Как глава КОНР, он рад использовать ее до тех пор, пока она служит своим интересам. Однако, если он посчитает комитет неэффективным органом, то Буняченко может без проблем взять контроль в свои руки."

 SAM_VIKTOR_MALTSEV_DESC:0 "Виктор Иванович Мальцев - человек, когда-то носивший некое подобие идеалов, служивший в РОА начальником военно-воздушных сил во время западно-русской войны и после нее. Наблюдение за хаосом послевоенной России изменило это, и пытки, которым подвергали его НКВД во время войны, сделали его очень горьким и соскребли с него все, что напоминало идеологическую мысль. Он видел в разрушенной России подтверждение неудач демократии, социализма и империи; он смотрит за границы либерализма и прав, чтобы обрести новое, проверенное решение.\n\n Немцы, по его мнению, не враги, а союзники. Как его опыт прошлой войны может свидетельствовать против этого? Он следит за каждым шагом немцев и копирует его, рассматривая их как народ, очистивший от них стремление к свободе и цивилизованности. Несмотря на то, что немцы могут по-разному относиться к нему, он является одним из самых преданных соратников в рядах РОА. Он находит свои цели как их и наоборот, не останавливаясь ни перед чем, чтобы ввести их в действие. За какую бы Россию он ни мечтал и за какую бы страну ни сражался, ее поглотила страстная жажда власти, заменив русского националиста человеком, чертовски склонным править кем угодно и чем угодно.\n\n Он не пролил ни слезинки после смерти Власова. Он ненавидел этого человека; Власов был слаб, Власов был слишком нерешителен. Напротив, он приветствовал это как божественный поступок. Теперь Самара - это Мальцев, а Мальцев - это Самара. Его политическая связь с Московией обеспечит постоянную помощь, и над его землями падает глубокая и темная тень. Бог завещал Мальцеву, как рулевому; верно это или нет, но это еще предстоит увидеть."
 
 SAM_MIKHAIL_OKTAN_DESC:0 "Восхождение Михаила Александровича Ильинича на пост Председателя КОНР, достойно названного "полным ублюдком", знаменует собой начало новой и темной главы в истории России. Известный под псевдонимом Октан, он циничен, манипулирует и исповедует рабскую лояльность к Рейху, неудивительно, что он нашел свое призвание в управлении непокорными русскими от имени своих хозяев - сначала в качестве газетного редактора и самопровозглашенного губернатора, затем в качестве главного пропагандиста КОНР. Под его руководством пропагандистские усилия после западно-русской войны выросли в десять раз, втянув в себя тысячи яростно настроенных противников большевистской войны и изгнав верных слабому, "свободному" видению России.\n\n Немногие, однако, предвидели бы его внезапный приход к власти. Когда-то Октан был известен не более чем как злобный, предательский, антисемитский пьяница. Еще в ранние годы Октан презирал Власова за его мягкость и отсутствие радикализма, отдаляя будущего диктатора от своих коллег. Его сопливое умиротворение немцев и отчаянное стремление вступить в ряды руководства Российской освободительной армии обеспечили ему, наконец, начало восхождения в ряды, стойкую оппозицию из лагерей Зыкова и Буняченко. Его соперники не жалели усилий, информируя народ о его трусости, лени и развратных действиях, но эти усилия сошли на нет.\n\n Сейчас они ничего не говорят. Те, кто осмеливаются шептать о нелояльности Октана Смоленской декларации и принципам КОНР, вскоре попадают под арест, чтобы столкнуться с "перевоспитанием" - или, что еще хуже, с "перевоспитанием". Многому научившись в прошлой дружбе с гестапо, Октан оказался беспощадным и жестоким в подавлении своей оппозиции и нежелании идти на компромисс во всем, что могло бы поставить под угрозу его абсолютное правление. Как человек, когда-то пользовавшийся полным доверием немцев, нельзя сказать, какие ужасы может принести правление Октана народу России."

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_POLYAKOV_DESC:0 "Как и его коллега на северо-западе, Виктор Николаевич Поляков был простым директором завода до того, как на него обрушилось электричество. Родившийся в Сибири, он оказался в правильном - или неправильном - месте в нужное время, чтобы быть отправленным в качестве промышленного советника быстро разваливающегося ЗРРФ в город Самару на берегу Волги, и в течение следующих нескольких лет именно там он и работал. Поляков быстро рос в автомобильной промышленности, даже конкурируя на том же рынке с Катюшевым.\n\n В конце концов, именно эта профессия сделала его известным в городе, а когда пришло время, его избрали лидером местного Народного Собрания и мэром Самары. Сейчас Поляков балансирует между экономикой и управлением примитивной и хрупкой демократией в соответствии с пожеланиями Севера России.\n\n В то время как управление как военачальник может быть трудным для человека с небольшим опытом в этом отношении, Поляков знает, как обратиться к своему коллеге-магнату в Нижнем Новгороде, когда дела действительно идут не так гладко."

 SAM_german_bootlickers_desc:0 "Как бы нам не хотелось утверждать, что мы являемся острием освобождения России от красного большевистского ига, все считают нас продолжением немецкого влияния на Родину и, соответственно, ненавидят нас за это.

 SAM_The_Smolensk_Manifesto_desc:0 "Доказательство легитимности ROA для избранных и доказательство их безвозвратного предательства для всех остальных. Манифест был издан во время Западно-Российской войны, объявив о противостоянии РОА коммунизму в России и надеждах на новую республику на смену Советскому Союзу. Несмотря на то, что Манифест был создан руками отчаянных немецких пропагандистов, он остался основным компонентом нашего притязания на легитимность."

В Западно-Русской Войне численность армии увеличилась вместе с бывшими ветеранами Красной Армии, и их боевые действия прошли испытание в отчаянных сражениях. Таким образом, РОА - одна из немногих профессиональных армий на Западе России."

Неважно, по какой причине и насколько они искусны, измена наших генералов русскому народу вызывает у них сильное отвращение к людям."

 SAM_Our_Guide:0 "Наш руководитель"
 SAM_Our_Guide_desc:0 "Еще один год продолжается, и наш руководитель Андрей Власов продолжает свои усилия по Сизифийскому завоеванию. Какую бы власть он ни собирал, его подопечные воруют. Какой бы легитимностью он ни обладал, немецкая бомбардировочная полоса уйдет. Печальный человек стареет, погребенный под тяжестью истории и суждения тех, кто вне его границ. Но он еще не сдался, ибо грядущие беды в Германии могут стать для него последним шансом.\n\n На данный момент его самым большим качеством является то, что он способен поддерживать коалицию. Различные генералы любят его больше, чем они любят друг друга, и народ нашел его правление справедливым, если не особенно достойным внимания. Конечно, в России есть места и похуже, чем в Самаре. Но если Власов должен служить проводником в обновленную Россию, он должен начать заново укреплять свою военную и народную поддержку."

 SAM_Our_Voice:0 "Наш голос"
 SAM_Our_Voice_desc:0 "Наши усилия по консолидации проходят через Мелетий Зыков. Зыкова трудно описать, так как большая часть его прошлого замаскирована тайной. Мало кто утверждает, что знает, откуда он родом. Сам он утверждает, что был ведущим идеологом в оппозиции к советской власти, и действительно показал себя очень талантливым оратором и пропагандистом. Его усилия, направленные на то, чтобы достучаться до народа России в целом и до Самары в частности, сделали многое, чтобы создать то, чем мы обладаем, - несколько клочков хорошей репутации. Зыков является одним из величайших защитников свободы и демократии в нашем офицерском корпусе, и он построил себе небольшую клику вокруг этой должности. Его цель - не просто освободить Россию и от военачальников, и от немцев, но создать новую, тщательно контролируемую демократию. Для многих милитаристов в нашем правительстве он мягкий человек. Для немецких лоялистов он - декадентский паразит, стремящийся предать наших немецких благотворителей.\n\n Мало кто знает, откуда взялся Зыков, и мало кто может утверждать, что знает его настоящий эндшпиль. Но в этот критический момент его навыки в пропаганде незаменимы. Нам нужен его голос, когда армия освобождения идет вперед."

 SAM_Our_General:0 "Наш генерал"
 SAM_Our_General_desc:0 "Теоретически существует иерархия Национально-освободительной Армии, в которой Власов наверху и ряд офицеров аккуратно распределены под ним. Однако на практике мнение офицерского корпуса в целом имеет решающее значение для нашей деятельности. А у офицерского корпуса и его комитета есть чемпион Сергей Буняченко. Бывший советский офицер, Буняченко был захвачен немцами во время второй мировой войны и брошен в исправительную колонию за свои неприятности.Мало кто в России оплакивал его судьбу, так как советское руководство широко обвиняло его в проигрыше нескольких критических сражений на первых этапах войны.\n\n В темные дни западно-русской войны Буняченко был предложен выход из тюремного заключения: вступить в Российскую Армию Национального Освобождения и оттолкнуть ЗРРФ обратно.  Разгневанный советским руководством и отчаянно желающий покинуть свою тюрьму, Буняченко согласился, и быстро поднялся в звании Национально-освободительной Армии. Буняченко повсеместно воспринимается как способный офицер, любимый людьми за то, что они отстаивают свои идеи. Генерала мало что волнует, кроме воссоединения России, уничтожения советского пережитка и, самое главное, падения Германии."

 SAM_Their_Puppet:0 "Их марионетка"
 SAM_Their_Puppet_desc:0 "Михаил Октан - трудный человек для своих сторонников, и сломленный человек для других. У него мало симпатий к коммунистическому режиму, дважды побежденному немцами за пятнадцать лет. Он не монархист и не демократ, ибо слабость этих прошлых режимов затянула Россию в оковы провалившегося коммунистического режима.\n\n Немцы стали хозяевами Европы, и что с того? Для Октана и его сторонников, Берлин сокрушил все Еврейские режимы, которые затмевали человеческий прогресс. Власов и его род, возможно, видят в немцах средство для достижения цели, но Октан знает об этом лучше. Он видит во Власове сломленного, жалкого человека, жаждущего выйти из-под немецкой тени.\n\n Михаил Октан рад сотрудничеству с Германией. Он не видит большей цели, чем помощь в навязывании немецкой воли на развалинах Советского Союза, и его горячее сотрудничество позволило ему обеспечить многие контакты в РК Московии и за его пределами. Михаил Октан может быть трудным человеком, или сломленным человеком, но он, безусловно, опасный человек. И важнейший, ибо через него Самара обеспечивает поставки предметов первой необходимости от немецкого людоеда."
 
 SAM_It_Never_Ends:0 "Это никогда не закончится"
 SAM_It_Never_Ends_desc:0 "Через непредсказуемые промежутки времени, самолеты прибывают над головой. Иногда их пункт назначения находится дальше в российском интерьере. В других, однако, они петляют над Самарой, чтобы сбросить свой груз, крича в воздух. Его частота остаётся непредсказуемой, никто не может привыкнуть к случайным бомбардировкам. Их можно просто выдержать.\n\n И все же ветры перемен все еще могут дуть. Впала ли Германия в собственные неприятности, возможно, это последние месяцы проклятых терактов? В связи с этим была собрана офицерская конференция, чтобы обсудить, как лучше подготовиться к предстоящему открытию новых возможностей. Различные фракции обращаются к Власову и другим офицерам.\n\n Тем временем продолжаются регулярные спасательные работы. Здания, снесенные военной машиной, видят, как их компоненты переносятся на новые места. Конвои снабжения, используемые в качестве мишеней, выталкиваются с дороги, чтобы другие могли пройти. Жизнь в России продолжается."

 SAM_Take_What_is_There:0 "Возьми то, что есть"
 SAM_Take_What_is_There_desc:0 "На конференции Зыков и его сторонники яростно отстаивали свою позицию как по идеологическим, так и по хладнокровным прагматическим мотивам.\n\n Их аргумент звучит так: повышение налогов с населения изгоняет его еще дальше от нас, а Армия национального освобождения едва ли может позволить себе потерять то, что до сих пор имеет мало намека на добрую волю. Принятие большего количества немецкого оружия также не является хорошим планом, так как наших солдат нужно видеть и называть "освободителями России", а не просто немецкими марионетками. Таким образом, лучший и самый трудный путь, по мнению Зыкова, - это сделать то, что у нас есть. Это оставит нас слабее в краткосрочной перспективе.

Самая насущная проблема - это постоянно сокращающийся парк моторизованных транспортных средств. Без большого количества отечественной промышленности и с ограниченными возможностями импорта, наш парк грузовиков и бронетехники плавится с каждым днем.\n\n Наши люди были посланы, чтобы прочесать сельскую местность в поисках всего, что могло бы скатиться вниз. Тракторы, от которых отказались крестьяне, брошенные в лесу военные автомобили и грузовики, все, что сломано немецким или советским танком, спрятанным в болотах или лесах. Этот урожай железа будет скудным, и большая часть того, что мы найдем, скорее всего, будет бесполезной.

Всё, что мы можем использовать, спрятано. Среди прочего, все, что имеет денежную ценность, перевозится в конвоях, направляющихся к Московской границе, где торговцы на черном рынке дадут нам часть своей цены за наши неприятности. Продажа брошенных часов с кукушкой и чайников не сделает нас богатыми мужчинами, но все, чем мы можем торговать на черном рынке за припасы, все равно будет иметь ценность.\n\n Чтобы подбодрить солдат, пятнадцать процентов стоимости каждого открытия отдается непосредственно мужчинам, чтобы побудить их к поискам. Конечно, любой солдат, который ворует у гражданских, чтобы увеличить свой тайник, будет расстрелян.

Граждане должны быть лучше интегрированы в нашу государственную структуру, чтобы дать им возможность честно пожать руку. Им повезло, что они одними из первых были освобождены КОНР, и они должны знать об этом.\n\n Таким образом, план Буняченко заключается в организации детальной переписи населения.  Как только население каждой деревни и общины станет нам известно, мы сможем начать оценку того, насколько близко овцы могут быть острижены, не нанеся им травм.

Их время было сосредоточено в мастерской, где производятся оружие и боеприпасы. Другие расчистили новый участок земли, чтобы выращивать пищу для солдат.

Бандитские операции все чаще сталкиваются с трещинами. Циник может сказать, что это для того, чтобы устранить конкуренцию нашим сборщикам налогов.

Пессимисты утверждают, что они остались от Второй мировой войны.\n\n Октан и его сторонники, похоже, не возражают против этого. Еда - это еда, а оружие - это оружие.

Теперь они - наш народ, как и любой русский, и мы обязаны относиться к ним так же хорошо, как и к любому русскому.\n\n Как только эти права будут закреплены на бумаге, беды прошлой войны, надеюсь, забудутся, и славяне и татары смогут идти рука об руку к лучшему будущему."

Если мы сможем вернуть завод в строй, наши силы будут укреплены танками - преимущество, не имеющее себе равных в этой части России, о чем свидетельствует тот факт, что военачальник, ранее оккупировавший эту землю, смог так долго выжить.\n\n Однако мы не допустим той же ошибки, что и Аверин: наши новые бронетанковые войска будут разумно интегрированы с пехотой и кавалерией, а также будут разработаны новые доктрины, диктующие их применение.

With this approach, everyone will be satisfied: our government will stabilize these territories, our army will be earning profit and have their own land to grow and settle, and the people there will live without fearing of instability, raids and attacks.

After Oktan's ascension, these men have stayed loyal to Zykov and Bunyachenko's side out of a desire to be on the winning team when the round of musical chair end.\n\nThese men can be persuaded to change side, were we to make a better offer than their current boss.

Our nation will be divided into military districts, ran by a stratocracy of skilled and loyal officers.

Mandatory IDs will be issued, assembly will be banned, and the disease that is Tatar culture will be expunged wherever it is seen in favor of that of their betters.

If the Tatars don't like being here so much, we'll give them a one-way ticket out of our land and give their possessions to Russians who can much better appreciate what we do for them.

Though less threatening now that the situation has stabilized, the officers represent a potential source of future opposition to our rule, and collect far more in salary money than can be justified given our resources.\n\nAs well as eliminating the more politically unreliable elements of our military, streamlining the officer corps is simply good practice. A less clunky and top-heavy military can only be beneficial. After all, any future factional infighting would destabilize the chain of command and potentially be a death blow to our government."

The task now is to aid development and better extend our reach in newly conquered territories.\n\nWe are unable to return to a peacetime economy at the present, but, if there's any lesson we can take from our former benefactors, it is that military expenditures can do wonders for rapid economic development. Redeploying soldiers across the region will allow us to fill gaps in regional economies, as well as secure our hold over far-flung areas.

Whether of insufficient quality or insufficient loyalty to the correct faction of the ROA, elements of our forces can not be trusted to maintain the honor, obedience, and fighting spirit that will bring us victory in our future challenges.\n\nTo put it another way, we are long overdue for a purge. Soldiers unable to meet tests of physical fitness or allegiance will be cast out of the army, with jail time for the most serious cases of possible treason.

Although it was more than sufficient to conquer West Russia, the ROA was not the well-oiled machine needed to reclaim the rest of the country from the despots and criminals occupying it.\n\nWith our recent reforms, that fact has changed. The army is now slimmer and more effective, united behind the political leadership in the name of our cause.

This will not suffice in our future battles; the enemies we have ahead of us will be larger, better-equipped, and more industrially formidable than our comparably meager previous foes.\n\nThe prospect of a serious disparity in equipment quality between us and our rivals is disconcerting enough to warrant immediate action.

Anything less would relegate our soldiers to battlefield inferiority in the coming days."

Our ground superiority allowed us to bulldoze our way through Russia, but this tactical state of affairs will not last. Our future opponents will be larger, more modern states, easily capable of fielding jet fighters and bombers.\n\nThe ROA needs to react with the utmost speed to these changing circumstances and create a new air force. With the productive capacity of West Russia's factories behind us, building planes is finally within our grasp. Subjugating our eastern rivals will require taking to the skies, and the ROA's best are well up to that task."

For leadership, we shouldn't spare anyone vital; this is not a serious priority at the moment, but few would turn down the chance to be the first admiral of the new Russia.

However, few agree on how such a legislative body should be staffed. Some propose elections, while others favor appointed technocrats chosen by a committee.

 SAM_zykov_new_territories_desc:0 "Our struggle for the land East of the Urals wasn't an easy one, but we're the clear victor, and now our administration spans from German-occupied Russia's borders in the West to points well beyond the impressive Ural mountains. But just because we won the battle doesn't mean that we've won the peace: much work must still be done to ensure that we win the hearts and minds of our new populations over.\n\nIt's time to prepare our new land for its integration into our fledgling democratic system. Already, Zykov's agents and administrators have been making inroads in Western Siberia, setting up polling stations and educational areas to prepare the long-oppressed people of Siberia for the onset of democracy, even if it isn't a perfect one. Yet."

 SAM_zykov_partial_elections_for_the_east_desc:0 "While democracy is coming to Siberia, it's still a fledgling, fragile democracy, and thus we should make sure that the people know how important it is to be voting for the right parties. We've already selected a number of our candidates from west of the Urals to cross the mountains and run as candidates there, but it's also a good idea to make sure that we find some local individuals who would be willing to work as members of our Yedinstvo party.\n\nRunning our own candidates and selecting local affiliates is far from the only thing that we should do to make sure that Siberia is firmly under our control - as the voice of the people, of course. Certain measures should be taken to make sure that Yedinstvo is not just an established, but the preeminent, party. Gerrymandering, in some form, will ensure that Zykov's representatives will remain the ascendant democratic force even far beyond the Urals."

 SAM_zykov_backroom_deals_desc:0 "Our own candidates aren't the only democrats in Siberia. When we liberated the area from our rivals, we were approached by a number of prominent individuals and their supporters in the hopes that we would help establish a functioning democracy in the region. This, of course, is something that we plan to do - eventually - and these individuals will be able to help us do it.\n\nWe'll need to make sure that these individuals, who are businessmen, local politicians, and ex-military men are on our side and members of the Yedinstvo, no matter the cost. Some of these men have already indicated that perhaps certain "deals" could be worked out between Zykov's administration in Samara and themselves: loyalty for a price."

 SAM_zykov_preparing_the_elections_desc:0 "Regardless of how we plan on approaching the democratic question in Siberia, there does need to be some cursory preparation for the actual elections themselves. For years, the people in this region have suffered under tyrants and dictators, let alone, before that, the Soviet system. Almost none of the people in our newly acquired territories remember, let alone understand, the importance of democracy.\n\nThus, a lot of work must be done to ensure that our new territory is properly prepared for the coming elections. People must be made aware of voting - how to do it, where and when, and, perhaps most importantly: why. Furthermore, we have to look at the administrative side of things, creating voting districts, hiring administrators and bureaucrats to ensure that votes are collected, tallied, and reported on correctly."

Ultimately, our new citizens are still just that: citizens of our republic. And thus, they should be treated as such.\n\nOf course, we will encourage as many people as possible to join and vote for Yedinstvo, but at the end of the day, no free nation forces its people to support a party that they're not invested in. The people should be given a choice - a real choice - to determine their future. This will ensure that our young and fragile democracy inspires real hope among the people."

 SAM_zykov_under_restraints_desc:0 "Of course, while it's always important to ensure that the people have a real voice and a right to self-determination, it's risky for us to completely allow the Russians of Siberia - with the weight of years of tyranny and oppression weighing on their shoulders - to vote wantonly for anyone that may rouse populist whims, filling the people's heads with sweet nothings.\n\nEven if we are to allow free and unadulterated election results in most of the East, there may be need to... work some things out. A district reshuffling here, and a small transfer of money there will ensure that the Yedinstvo will have an actual presence in the places where they need to."

Now that he is serving in an official capacity as the civilian head of state for the Russian Republic, and as Russia has now been liberated, there is little need for the KONR anymore - they have achieved their stated goal. Of course, the actual abolition of KONR may be a little more difficult than signing a piece of legislature: the organization is thick with bureaucratic red tape, and has its tendrils in every part of the new republic's administration."

 SAM_zykov_consolidating_business_desc:0 "One of the surprising products of Russia's warlord era was the beginning and expansion of a number of businesses and corporations across Siberia and the Far East, operating in legal capacities or otherwise. Ever since our victories in the wars of unification, a lot of these businesses have been in legal limbo, some still operating while others are frozen for various reasons.\n\nWe should make a list of the businesses that have since emerged following the collapse of the Union and figure out which should be brought into the public sector of our burgeoning governmental sector, which should be encouraged to rejoin the now-official private sector of our economy, or simply be shut down entirely."

 SAM_zykov_improving_the_unity_party_desc:0 "Truthfully, the Unity Party, or Yedinstvo in Russian, is a mish-mash of ideologies primarily united by those associated with the former Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, those who were loyal to Zykov, and local prominent individuals who have been bought to help "manage" the republic's growth. Sometimes it feels as if the Unity Party is not a party at all, instead a voting bloc of various interest groups!\n\nTo ensure that the Unity Party remains united, the chairman has decided to trim the party's fat, so to speak, by smoothing over the reconcilable differences, removing some of the more troublesome party members, and reinforcing his hegemony over the party. This way, Zykov will make sure that Yedinstvo will stay the dominant party, guided by an actual vision - Zykov's vision."

Not only did they fund him in return for what they believed would end up as a beneficial partnership between them, they also actively worked with the now-president to make sure that the Russian economy would be, in time, rapidly revitalized.\n\nOf course, while the Eastern half of Russia is much more sparse in terms of people, let alone wealthy businessmen, they certainly still exist. We should scour our new territories to find anyone who would be able to forge similar connections with the president and the party in return for their local support for Zykov's agenda."
 
 SAM_zykov_military_business_oversight:0 "Military Business Oversight"
 SAM_zykov_military_business_oversight_desc:0 "Long has the distinction between military officer and CEO been blurred for many members of the Russian Liberation Army, who have, for years, been both serving in the capacity of commissioned officers within our armed forces and leaders of businesses. This has come to be known as "military business oversight". For some time, this worked when the Russian Liberation Army was eking out an existence in the city of Samara, barely being able to hold its own against raiders, bandits, and German bombs. However, Zykov has done his best to ensure that this system, well-entrenched in parts of Western Russia, doesn't expand any further.\n\nDespite all best efforts, certain reports point to the further expansion of this system east of the Urals - a development that has alarmed the president and his supporters. Zykov has called for an immediate covert investigation into the expansion of this so-called "oversight". Whether or not he feels as if he can control it, or if he'll move to stem its growth is yet to be seen."
 
 SAM_zykov_democratic_officers:0 "Democratic Officers"
 SAM_zykov_democratic_officers_desc:0 "While the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia was, formally, entirely subservient to Zykov, the reality of the situation was much more complex, with a lot of more reactionary and troublesome individuals more interested in more authoritarian ways of governing... or worse. Truthfully, the old guard of the Russian Liberation Army and KONR have long been a thorn in the president's side, especially as they continue to grumble about Zykov's increasingly democratic vision.\n\nIt's time for this old guard to be put out to pasture. They've served long, and they've served hard, and it's for these exact reasons that these officers - well used to having a very present opinion in politics, should be replaced with a new generation of officers - free from the stains of collaboration and corruption, fresh faces, local faces, to help begin the process of depoliticizing the army."

The president has decreed today that schools, be they primary, secondary, or post-secondary institutions, shall be all funded by the government, with generous research grants to be handed out to the most promising of scholars at all ages.\n\nOf course, while this is far from cheap, it's an investment - not one that will yield economic results, but an investment into the future of Russia, and, of course, the future of the Unity Party. After all, it was the Unity Party that sponsored the institutions and gave out the grants. And we will make sure that the new generation of talent will remember this - they shall serve Russia, but they will also serve Yedinstvo."

In this world, it would be a fool's errand to neglect a nation's armed forces - and the president has no intention of doing so.\n\nThe army marched to victory, marching east and pushing our rivals out of their bunkers, cities, and barracks. Now, our army must continue to march - to train, to drill, and to be ready for any future threat. A generous amount of funding shall be bestowed on the army, to keep them happy and combat-ready for when it comes time to look west and liberate the last of Russia."

President Zykov has created a deep state within the new republic, a body of influential politicians, officers, and businessmen who all work towards the vision that the president has for the nation. The industries are booming, the people are feeling hopeful for the future and are slowly learning the intricacies of Zykov's democracy. And most of all - the military knows its place and is closely monitored by Zykov's friends in high places.\n\nThe dream of a true Russian Republic has never been closer - and the president knows that now, more than ever, the Russian people must be tempered for the future."

He has prepared to make this statement across international air waves, as well as on a very publicized broadcast domestically.\n\nZykov has formulated what he believes is the best path forward for Russia in the international sphere, now that he has finally unified the nation. Emphasizing the strength of Russia and unilaterally denouncing the Nazis as criminals and warmongers, Zykov also intends on praising the efforts of the United States and the Organization of Free Nations, which, he believes, will bring the republic closer to the West, and by extension, those best equipped to help Russia when the time comes to push west and make whole the ROA's long journey towards a free, strong Russia."

Now, the Republic's future is strengthened by our capture of Western Siberia. The land beyond the Ural contains important industrial centers. More importantly, its rich oil fields are critical resources in our drive to reunite the motherland.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and his allies have big plans for the region.

Yet we are a long way from total victory. In the east, rivals to unification still stand. In the west, Germans rightfully live in fear of our further progress. And within our state, traitors scheme our downfall.\n\nIn the east, remnants of the communist program in Tyumen as well as fanatics of the defeated black league are angry about our takeover. In the west, our industrial program has created a lot of winners and a lot of losers. Many agitate for further labor rights. Many of those agitating are useful idiots for communist remnants of the WRRF.\n\nWe must be vigilant, and monitor dissenting groups. The Republic must stand strong."
 
 SAM_bunyachenko_business_opportunity:0 "Business Opportunity"
 SAM_bunyachenko_business_opportunity_desc:0 "President Bunyachenko's decision to jumpstart our industrial development through Japanese inspired, vertically integrated financial groups has begun to give great results. Steel and energy production are skyrocketing; advanced goods such as military hardware and consumer electronics are beginning to roll out of the Kombinats' factories at ever greater speed.\n\nTo keep this momentum, the growing Kombinats must continue to expand, and establish themselves in the eastern territories. Ressources there are endless; local businessmen underestimate the cunning and rapacity of our industrial collosi. By maintaining a carefully managed pool of great corporations, we can reap the benefits of centralised economic might with free market induced competition and evolution."

 SAM_bunyachenko_growing_prestige_desc:0 " Rising economic and military might are nothing in politics without reputation. The image of a country, its prestige, forms the third leg of the power trinity wielded by all nations. In this regard, our young Republic is remarkably deficient. Our enemies are quick to remind us our humble beginnings. They call our government a jumped up junta of collaborationist have-been, led by a dour military officer. A loud but persistent minority of our citizens are likely to agree with this assessment, decrying our current economic miracle as exploitative and unjust.\n\nTo rectify this, our government shall engage in a calculated bout of "useful splendor". A few vanity projects here and there; a few high quality apartment buildings for journalists and members of the intelligentsia; a few visits from foreign journalists. Converting the budgetary equivalent of table scraps into soft power will give us yet another tool in our arsenal to crush all threats to Russia."

 SAM_bunyachenko_new_propaganda_tide_desc:0 "President Bunyachenko is not shy about the errors he committed in a long life. However, he and his comrades in the ROA stand by the fact that helping turn the tide against the WRRF was not a mistake. Already the German empire decays, whereas communism endures across the world.\n\nWe must help convey this to all of the nation's population. The Reds' inability to defeat the Reich and restore stability to Russia was by far the greatest menace to our people's future. President Bunyachenko, aided by his wise advisors, is an epoch making man. An economic and industrial boom the like of which has only been seen so far in Manchuria is in the making, a veritable ecosystem of steel and progress wrought into existence through the Russian man's hard work. Our President has made this possible, and the ROA will make sure that the envious Germans are not able to violently bring it all down. Some may call this a propaganda campaign. How can the spreading of truth be mere propaganda?"

This does not mean that the sphere's moneymen are perfect; in their hubris, the Japanese have failed to put checks and balance on their financial systems. This came crashing down when piles of bad debts destroyed the Yasuda zaibatsu and started the Japanese Economic Wars.\n\nTo avoid this fate we can use our central bank as a tool of defence. Every Kombinat will be forced to keep a certain amount of cash on hand, and keep an up to date plan to deal with a market downturn. Every year or so, agents of our government will be allowed to announce a surprise inspection, to verify the stability of each firm's finances. People trying to fudge numbers will be dealth with severely.\n\nThere will be no hubris here. We've come too far to let mere greed upset the stability of Russian recovery. The Kombinats are given great powers; they will owe us great responsibility. For the good of all."

Our government of course also realizes the importance of a free market in a free and strong Russia. Nevertheless, many of these businesses in the eastern provinces are run by people with ties to opposition groups, or by personnel with little interest in our glorious national rejuvenation. As such our bureaucrats are drafting lists of corporations that need to go. Their assets will be auctioned off; their subsidiaries acquired by various Kombinats. This will raise money for the central government, and help the growth of our business partners, all the while reducing overlap in business."

The Russian people tire of being seen as poor and hopeless masses; showing our citizens that our state is admired and respected once more will be great for national pride.\n\nWe've already begun inviting foreigners to visit Russia; mostly foreign dignitaries and men from intelligence agencies, at first. It is time to extend this policy to business men, journalists, and anyone else that controls the narrative about Russia. To aid this process we can send out our own people. Businessmen, yes, but also our youth. It is time for Russian youth to be given a chance to study abroad, to see the world that the German ogres have endeavored to deny them.

Having dealt with this issue, it is time to turn our attention elsewhere.\n\nEastern Russia still eludes us. In the meantime, the political structures built by President Bunyachenko are still fragile. It is important to continue the elimination of the old officer's clique, even as we transition the ROA into the apolitical Republican Army. We do not know if diplomacy will the eastern unifier will fail, but we are quite certain that the Germans will not be willingly evicted from our stolen land.\n\nNo sacrifice is too great for the final war of liberation.

The first step in this process is to hold elections for the Duma in the east, ensuring that Russians on both sides of the Urals are represented in the lower house of the government. We should schedule these elections as quickly as we can, as they will legitimize our government in the eyes of many people who might otherwise resent our new rule.\n\nOf course, the Duma does not hold any real power in the government by design. We will be able to hold free and fair elections knowing that the outcome will not matter. While the people pick their candidates and believe they are participating in democracy we will continue to steer Russia down the correct course, free of burdensome legislative restrictions and bickering politicians."

Under Zykov's rule officers and generals held all the power, and the government was barely more than a rubber stamp for their plans. This state of affairs hampered our efforts to reclaim Russia, politicizing the army and making the government inefficient. It is the role of the military to defend the state and the role of the government to administer it. Luckily Bunyachenko's ascension saw this problem begin to end as the old generals retired from both the military and politics. We should encourage this depoliticizing trend, appointing qualified and loyal commanders who understand their job is to serve the government, not run it."

There are more conflicts on the horizon, but before they begin our generals need time to plan and prepare.\n\nWhile the high command prepares for the next battles, we can reward those who will fight them with a vacation. Maintaining the morale of the soldiers on the ground is vital, and nothing boosts morale quite like a trip away from the barracks and the front lines. By the time the next war begins our troops will be refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to bring glory to Russia once more."

Once we were limited to arming our military with the few guns we could produce and whatever outdated tanks and planes we could convince the Germans to sell us. Now we are able to build a new generation of cutting edge Russian weapons that will stand with the finest products of Germany, America, and Japan. New interceptor aircraft will knock enemy planes from our skies, keeping our cities safe, while long-range missiles capable of striking anywhere on earth will force the great powers to take us seriously."

As we prepare to retake the far east of Russia and finally reunite the nation we should work to secure Japanese support for our endeavours.\n\nInviting diplomats will deepen our ties to the imperial government, while accepting Japanese businessmen will open the door to economic investment from some of the largest corporations in the world.\n\nIf all goes well, once we have reclaimed eastern Siberia there may even be further opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation."

Now, as conflict with the Germans looms once more, our western provinces are under threat again. Just like last time our territory stretches for thousands of kilometers, but the majority of our industry is located within a few hundred of the enemy border. We must change this. All factories, especially those that produce military goods, capable of relocation will move east of the Urals towards central Siberia.

Our technological industry is not advanced enough to replicate these designs on our own, so we must ask for help from our new partners in the Pacific.

 ### Events ###
 SAM.1.t:0 "The Old Man"
 SAM.1.d:0 "Vlasov's aides walked constantly to-and-fro the old man's office, the tidal nature of their movement echoing the old man's current situation. Even in these desperate times, few could stomach working directly for the traitor general himself. Those that managed to either ignore or muster indifference towards the accusations against Vlasov found themselves buried in drudgery: bored out of their wits instead of merely disgusted by the stench of treason. Better, perhaps, to pray for an assignment on the border instead where death and starvation dispelled the lethargy.\n\nVlasov stood on political quicksand, his position shifting and changing by the day but never improving. Some of his aides suspected that the old man would have preferred being genuinely hated by his generals instead of their current indifference. In the college of traitors that filled the ROA's upper echelon, Vlasov was not particularly liked, but nor was he disliked. Whatever coalition or common ground he tried to build usually disintegrated within the month.\n\nBut if the old general could not be liked by everyone, he could at least try to gin up love and hatred within specific factions. Under him Zykov's democrats constantly agitated against Oktan's war profiteers. In between, schemed the officer's committee, General Bunyachenko their puppet.\n\nVlasov had long pondered on which factions to cast his full and hollow weight behind. His remaining scraps of authority would tip the balance. Now that the time for a decision had come, the general's own aide could scarcely guess which side Vlasov would choose, nor how the ROA's future would play out as a result."
 SAM.1.a:0 "The Traitor General is not yet done."

 SAM.2.t:0 "Our Voice"
 SAM.2.d:0 ""Welcome, welcome!" Zykov had his bodyguard usher in Vlasov's aide, firmly holding on to the General's package. "It is good to see you, we never hear enough from commander Vlasov."\n\nThe ever energetic propagandist of the ROA held a hazy position in the army's leadership. While not officially on the officer's committee, Milety Zykov had wormed his way into a comfortable office in Samara's principal headquarters. Supporters of his faction could be seen streaming in and out at various times. A few stacks of pamphlets rested on the office's varied furniture.\n\nZykov almost yanked the package from the aide's hands after his swift introduction and began leafing through it, whistling all the while."Interesting...interesting." were the propagandist's only comments. For his trouble, Vlasov's aide was given a new package. "Bring it to your boss, alright?" Zykov said, with characteristic cheer. Moments later, the aide found himself escorted back outside. The stream of visitors had brought even more officers to the corridor, all waiting for a chance to speak with Zykov. None of them appeared too surprised to see one of Vlasov's own aides coming out of the office, expecting the commander to keep in touch with his own prime propagandist. Still, some looks followed him through the corridor, with Zykov's voice ringing out from behind closed doors.\n\n"Menshikov, you handsome bastard! What's the news?""
 SAM.2.a:0 "Does Zykov's energy know no bounds?"

 SAM.3.t:0 "Our General"
 SAM.3.d:0 "It was unusual for Bunyachenko to request private delivery of messages. Usually the officer committee read and responded to all of Vlasov's communiques leaving Bunyachenko not particularly involved in the day to day operations of the faction he nominally led, hence how surprising it was for him to bother reading Vlasov's communications.\n\nThe general locked the door behind the aide, before sitting back at his office. The room was austere, with no luxury other than a small furnace in one corner. The aide waited as the general read through a few of the sets of documents. One paper in particular gave the general pause. The aide recognized Vlasov's signature at the bottom. Bunyachenko read the letter a few times, before strenly looking up.\n\n"Who else knows the content of this bundle of documents, soldier?"\n"Only I and Vlasov, sir."\n\n"Good. You are dismissed." Bunyachenko crumpled the letter in a ball and threw it in his furnace before unlocking the door. Like that, the aide found himself back in the corridor, empty save for the faint sound of fire, consuming."
 SAM.3.a:0 "Special correspondence between Bunyachenko and Vlasov?"

 SAM.4.t:0 "Our Puppet Master"
 SAM.4.d:0 "Vlasov's aide was guided into Oktan's office by two stern bodyguards. Their boss sat behind an office, reading reports and documents from across the border with the Reich in between puffs of smoke. Ever genial, the General stood up to greet Vlasov's envoy with a handshake.\n\n"Can I invite you to indulge in some tobacco? Fresh arrival from our western neighbor."\n\nThe aide glanced at the box of expertly rolled cigarettes. It had been so long since he'd last had a proper smoke. The thought of owing something to Oktan, however, no matter how insignificant, gave the aide some pause. Still, good tobacco was good tobacco. "Thank you, commander."\n\nThe aide placed on Oktan's desk the package he had been tasked to bring, and then helped himself to a few cigarettes. Oktan smiled.\n"I've heard good things about you, soldier. If you ever find yourself looking to carry out a couple of favours, please come visit me. I've no greater concern than my men's quality of life,"\n\nA tempting offer for sure. The aide nodded again to Oktan and followed the guards back outside. One of them offered him a light. The aide walked back to Vlasov's offices, savoring the rare pleasure of good tobacco. It had been months, if not years."
 SAM.4.a:0 "Perhaps owing Oktan is not so bad after all."

 SAM.5.t:0 "The Pantry"
 SAM.5.d:0 "The planes had come during the early morning supply run. Local peasants carrying bags of flour into the pantry disappeared in a cloud of smoke and debris. By the time the soldiers had dug them out two had already died, crushed by falling debris. The final survivor's left leg had been reduced to pulp by the building's collapse. Outside his relatives wailed as men of the ROA dragged out the unconscious body. The poor bastard was placed on a cart, his family given a few bags of food to help cushion the loss of a working age man.\n\nThe garrison's captain reviewed his troops as they continued digging out the pantry and salvaging as much of the food as possible. One recruit, a young lad from the nearby villages, looked particularly grim as he shovelled bits of concrete out into the yard.\n\n"Why the long face, soldier? It's not the first time the Germans bomb us, yes?"\n The young man paused and saluted the officer stiffly. "Sir, ah, hmm."\n"Speak"\n"It's just, uh, sir, the men of the village, they said that the ROA had a deal with the Germans, uh, sir. That their bases were not bombed."\n\nThe officer laughed. "Is this what they say in whatever shithole we dragged you out of? That the Germans have an ounce of mercy? That they give a shit about their old conscript army?"\n"Uh, yes, sir!"\n"Well, there's your answer." The officer gestured toward the collapsed building where the other soldiers were pretending to work. "There's the answer for all of you. The ROA's got nothing but what we can get ourselves. Now get back to work, at this pace your dinner will mold under this pile of concrete."
 SAM.5.a:0 "Sir, yes sir!"
 
 SAM.6.t:0 "The Plight of the Common Man"
 SAM.6.d:0 "The young officer's speech had been short and crisp. Zykov's usual pointman in tough debates within the ROA's officer corp, Major Sergey Ivanovich, spoke to the assembled grandees of the ROA for his absent master.\n\nBetween the monotone droning, empty boasting and all-round boredom so common to the ROA's conferences, Ivanovich's style was refreshing in its earnest simplicity. "Yes." the young man agreed, it would be unfair for the ROA's commanders and soldiers to weather even more deprivation. It would be easier to take from the peasants, or to kowtow to the Germans for supplies. Every man with a gun west of moskowien had found himself doing either of those things at some point and besides, they were already known as bootlickers and collaborators! What would they lose by forsaking the last shreds of honour and goodwill they still had?\n\nNo. The men of the Army of National Liberation should and could be better than that. Each increase in taxation bled away at the army's dwindling popular support. This situation could not go forward. As to German weapons, what of them? Military surplus that had been used to massacre the motherland's children, given to them kindly by the twentieth century's greatest criminals. The ROA would do better.\n\nThe words of the Zykovite faction had been idealistic, yes. Naive, perhaps. But they stood out from the hopeless pragmatism of Bunyachenko's faction, and from Oktan's weary and greed-fueled cynicism. The officers voted for Ivanovich's proposed austerity, under the watchful eye of enlisted men."
 SAM.6.a:0 "Our current supplies will have to do."

 SAM.7.t:0 "No Protection without Taxation"
 SAM.7.d:0 "General Bunyachenko had not risen to his current position of mouthpiece for the stratocracy clique for nothing. Today, the general's simple logic and well structured argumentation had carried the day and won a majority of the officer corp's votes. After all, "How can the people of Samara expect the proud men of the ROA to defend them and maintain peace without food and supplies?"\n\nGeneral Bunyachenko's handlers within the officer corp could be seen nodding and whispering to one another as the resolution to increase taxation had passed. Word on the street had the dominant officer clique fear losing the vote to Oktan or Zykov's factions. The current system of a strictly defined hierarchy and of equality within the same rank of officers worked well. The conservative officers feared that Oktan's small group of profiteers and smugglers or Zykov's assembly of democrats would destroy the ROA's professionalism.\n\nThe tax harvest would bring in a considerable amount of supplies, and demonstrate to the common soldier that the current system worked well. Perhaps General Vlasov would take notes when looking for a successor... or a group of successors?"
 SAM.7.a:0 "The officer corps knows best how to lead the ROA."
 
 SAM.8.t:0 "The German Connection"
 SAM.8.d:0 "After a heated debate, Oktan's proposal served as a good compromise. There would be no austerity for the troops and officers. Nor would the supplies be taken at gun points from terrified civilians. Requests would be put in through both official and unofficial channels for more German supplies. Ammunition, rifles, clothes, food, whatever the Reich deigned to give or sell to the ROA. Pragmatists in RK Moskowien had long accepted that having part of the long frontier with the Russian Anarchy be controlled by something other than bandits or Russian revanchist was worth its weight in gold.\n\nOf course, Oktan had to explain a share of questions and accusations from skeptical officers. Complaints that relying on official German shipments would undermine the ROA's reputation were defty addressed. Those inclined to hate the Army of National Liberation would continue to do so, while neutral Russian citizens could dismiss these rumors. Others accused Oktan of simply trying to score a big contraband take. To this the general smiled and patiently explained that his network of contracts would make the whole operation possible, and that every shipment could be audited by an independent commission if needed.\n\nIn the end the objections would not sink down the idea. It was too good a way for the conservative officers and the Zykovites to save face. Even allowing Oktan a little profiteering was deemed an acceptable price."
 SAM.8.a:0 "Commander Oktan only has our interests at heart."

The old man still commanded, if not universal respect, then grim curiosity from the officer's corp.\n\n"Friends of the National Liberation Army and of KONR. Ever since your valiant efforts have freed the land around Samara, opponents to our liberation efforts have perpetually tried to undermine our rule. Their attempts to spread discontentment has not been helped by the endless bombing campaign and the frequent economic problems imposed on the Russian people by the Anarchy."\n\n"As the time to renew our efforts to free Russia approach, this opposition cannot be tolerated.

 SAM.10.t:0 "A second Opinion"
 SAM.10.d:0 "The men of the village sat somber in their church, wearing the least filthy and least bloodied - though still noticeably so - of their holiday attires. Chairs had been gathered in a rough circle, centered on the strange man from Samara. Leaning against the walls was an array of soldiers, their weapons dangling casually from rifle slings.\n\n"Friends and brothers! You've been called to this meeting to help assist the Army of Russian Liberation! It has always been our hope to bring freedom and democracy to the lands under our control. Today, we come to hear from you and your kin. What are some issues you'd like to see addressed? How we hope to improve your lives, citizens?"\n\nAn embarrassed silence. Someone raises their hand halfway, before reconsidering. Not fast enough for the indefatigable friend of the people. Zykov pointed to the man."You, my friend, you have something on your mind?"\n\n"It's just, ah, sir, the soldiers come around for taxes, but it's never the same amount. I thought, uh, that we'd like to know in advance how much they need. S-so we can be prepared to hand it out to them, Sire." Zykov nodded at this. Encouraged, a few others brought up complaints, always respectfully to the soldiers of the room. Long dormant ruins that occupied their fields, bombing raids that left a good half of the village's people homeless, mines and half-awake bombs that detonated in the night...Little by little, a picture emerged of the myriad of problems affecting this here village out in the middle of nowhere. The ROA's chief propagandist would put this information to good use, a few patrols should see to their needs sufficiently... And hoped that the villagers would remember their benefactor in return."
 SAM.10.a:0 "A man of the people, Miletiy Zykov."

 SAM.11.t:0 "Distribution Day"
 SAM.11.d:0 "The ROA's men usually left their garrison in force once a month to gather whatever resources and meager crops that counted towards taxation. Other times, inhabitants of the region could be forgiven for forgetting the existence of the so-called army of liberation. There were few bandits in the area, and so the ROA's did not bother with much more than token patrols.\n\nToday, unusually, the soldiers were marching out and about. From the garrison depot on their convoy snaked through to the small hamlets, horses and men weighed down with cargo. As it turned out, the ROA's new policy of redistribution had begun.\n\nVillages in areas generally deficient in food were given rations and grain. Communities that had lost men and workers to bombing, drafting or injuries were compensated with dozens of work hours from the local garrison. In a few places, it was gleefully reported, astonished kids received candies from the quartermasters.\n\nThis calculated generosity impressed the weary villagers in its cynicism. With the new hand-outs, life would be tolerable, instead of a grinding wait before certain starvation. In the meantime however, men and women would hopefully be too busy eating to listen to anti-ROA agitators."
 SAM.11.a:0 "We're already beating their low expectations!"

 #event for foci the hard way
 SAM.12.t:0 "The Daily Triage"
 SAM.12.d:0 "Political prisoners were tossed in daily, captured from throughout Samara by Oktan's crackdown. In overcrowded common cells, men wallowed in filth and anger as they waited for the daily triage.\n\nEven dissidents plotting against the ROA were of use to Oktan's faction. Each prisoner would go through a battery of psychological tests and brutal examinations, before being sorted into one of three groups. Those judged too dangerous or that would never comply to orders were executed. The next group was filled with men who despised the ROA but who were too docile to stir up trouble by themselves. These men were escorted to various work camps, where their labor would help maintain the state that kept their families safe. Of course, the laborers would be paid and fed. Good behavior might even see some of this hard earned money trickle back to their families.\n\nFinally, there were those that would do anything to earn their freedom. Joining communist or bandit groups had been for them a tremendous lapse of judgement. These men paid a punitive fine to the ROA, and were allowed to walk free. Their path out of the prison took them in front of the holding cells, where angry men of their hometown could see who had bent the knee. Back home, the freed prisoners would only find work and safety through continued submission to the ROA.\n\nPolitical prisoners were tossed in daily, but at an ever slowing pace. The crackdown had been swift and merciless. Peace would return to Samara, its communities more silent than ever as working age men were taken away for triage."
 SAM.12.a:0 "They shall not trouble us again."
 
 SAM.13.t:0 "In the Halls of Power"
 SAM.13.d:0 "It had been a welcome relief to leave the frontiers for an extended trip to Samara. Balashov was used to permissions being granted in muddy shitholes with terrible alcohol and even worse brothels.\n\nHis presence in Samara, however, would not be for R&R. With rumbles of a new set of wars in western Russia, almost every officer that could make the trip had been invited to give their say in a final leadership conference. The officers committee claimed every officers' opinion would be taken into account. The officers committee claimed a lot of things.\n\nThe most pressing topic was on everybody's lips. Who would succeed Vlasov as chairman. Balashov really did not care. He suspected few others did. Far from the little games played in Samara, the vast majority of the ROA spent most of its time patrolling, training, and keeping an eye out on the locals. None of them knew what the future would bring. Making such plans was the hobby of Samara's elite clique.\n\nBalashov had been twenty two when the Germans drafted him. Twenty five when they had forced him at gunpoint to leave his fiancee and fight the communists. He was now thirty five, he had no idea what had become of his fiancee, his children. He had long since given up on returning home. Perhaps the candidates to succeed Vlasov might convince him to keep hope again."
 SAM.13.a:0 "Most likely not."
 
 SAM.14.t:0 "A Kindred Spirit"
 SAM.14.d:0 "In theory the day's topic was merely about the best way to administer newly liberated areas. A young captain had made a passionate speech about collaboration and partnership with the local civilians. The next officer to speak was commander Bunyachenko, the usual mouthpiece of the upper echelon of the officers' committee. Balashov was less interested in Bunyachenko's speech than in the man himself. After all the general's arguments were the usual rhetoric about the dangers of giving too much power to the masses; it was a fine refutation delivered with the general's hint of an Ukrainian accent. No, Balashov was more interested in the officers' committee's mouthpiece than in his message.\n\nBunyachenko's grim expression reminded Balashov of his and his men's. An unhappy determination, a decade of sorrows and losses. The only time the general's eyes lit up was when he mentioned the hated communists and Germans that had stolen their future. Commander Bunyachenko was a hard man and one whom Balashov would gladly follow in battle. The only mystery left unresolved in Balashov's mind was about Bunyachenko's dreams. Would such a man remain the officers' committee's puppet like Vlasov had become? Or would he use his status as chairman to be something more?"
 SAM.14.a:0 "Perhaps there's still some life in him."
 
 SAM.15.t:0 "Chasing the Setting Sun"
 SAM.15.d:0 "The day's conferences had ended. Balashov and a few other officers from his district had settled on a local bar to get refreshments after a day of talking. Like most of the city of Samara for the congress, the establishment was filled to the brim with men of the ROA.\n\nIn one corner Balashov recognized one of the Zykovite democracy proponents that had given an impassioned speech. The speaker waved Balashov and his friends over, offering them seats next to his own group of officers. Without much thought Balashov headed toward the chair, signalling to the barman for a drink. Why not spend the evening with the Zykovites, why not?\n\nIn person the pro-democracy speaker was much more personable than Balashov had expected. A colonel from the border region with the Orenburg communes, the man was an old hand of the West Russian War. Conversations drifted from topic to topic. Memories of the desperate struggle against the WRRF. The famous operation to secure the south eastern territories from bandits in the aftermath of the Front's collapse. If the Colonel's assignment was in the quiet south east sector, it was because he had helped make it quiet.\n\n"So, what's an old hand like you doing with Zykov and his jumped up peasants turned junior officer? Don't you have better things to do than help that fool?" One of Balashov's comrades asked, his tongue loosened by drink. The colonel's drinking friends flashed grimaces, but the colonel himself shrugged. "When we crushed the bandits, the locals in the south east were grateful. After decades of pointless struggle in the Red Army, then the ROA, it felt nice, you know? Fighting for something. Zykov's a strange man, but he's one with a plan. Like me, he dreams of going west. Freeing Moskowien. I don't know if my home town will ever welcome me back. But if I can get buried next to my ancestors, that's one thing the Germans won't have taken from me." The colonel finished his drink."
 SAM.15.a:0 "Perhaps the ROA too will set in the west."
 
 SAM.16.t:0 "The Other Road"
 SAM.16.d:0 "Balashov hitched a ride on a troop truck back home with fellow officers. A few discussed the leadership conference. Most of the others discussed their most recent acquisition from the capital. Booze, tobacco, a few odds and ends. One of the lieutenants showed off his new toy, a sleek Walter PPK pistol to replace the aging P38 pistol he had been given upon recruitment into the ROA.\n\nMany of the men in the truck had a significantly better haul than their meagre salary should have allowed. Balashov thought of the friendly officers in the capitals, associate of commander Oktan. The trade with Moskowien was an entire organization all of its own, and its members were some of the richest and most generous of the ROA.\n\nAt the leadership conference they too had argued for their boss as successor to Vlasov. They railed against Zykov's foolish idealism, and against Bunyachenko's lethargic puppeteers in the officer's committee. The ROA was strong. Should it not have a strong leader? One able to provide for the soldiers and officers? One able to enforce discipline, order and progress throughout Russia? At least, so Oktan's proxies had talked during the conference. They had talked and they had given out much goodies. It paid to be friendly with men that held so many... contacts. Balashov had not taken anything from these men yet. But the option remained on his mind..."
 SAM.16.a:0 "They can ease the pain."
 
 SAM.17.t:0 "Vlasov's Secret Speech"
 SAM.17.d:0 "Today, Andrey Vlasov has reluctantly made what will in time be known as "Vlasov's Secret Speech" to his most senior and long-standing officers of the ROA, announcing his successor. It's been a well-known, if unspoken, fact that the aging chairman has not been in good temperament recently, and many have long expected this day to come.\n\nOne of Vlasov's aides attended him as he prepared his final speech, announcing the chairman's successor within the hour. He was expected by the officer committee fifteen minutes ago for a standard meeting before the announcement, but he hadn't bothered attending. The aide, one of the few allowed into the chairman's room, silently observed the old marshal. His brow was furrowed, and despite the rather chilly temperatures of the office, it seemed that his face glistened with sweat. He was intensely staring at the script, scribbled by hand onto a piece of paper - not reading it or editing it, just staring. The aide checked his watch. "Sir, I-" he tried to hurry the marshall along, well-familiar with the punishment he may receive for Vlasov being late of his own accord. Vlasov however put up a hand as soon as the aide spoke, silently terminating the aide's hope to get things moving. The marshal stood up, slowly, and delicately folded the piece of paper up into his pocket. "Shall we?" he asked the aide. "Yes, sir." the aide responded.\n\nThe old marshal stood in front of his officers, some of them having been with him since the earliest days of the ROA. He looked at all of them - seeing familiar faces, but, for the first time, more than a few faces that he didn't recognize. Could they be new? Vlasov asked himself, the silence in the room deadening as all looked to him and waited. Or had he simply forgotten who they were? Sighing, Vlasov looked down at his paper, and spoke at last:\n\n"As you all know, I am not getting any younger. It has time for me to announce a formal successor to the Russian Liberation Army's Chairman position. And for this, I have chosen...""

 SAM.18.d:0 "Miletiy Zykov and a number of his more prominent allies sat in one of the many formal conference rooms common to the governmental buildings that dotted Samara. Now that he had begun to grab a hold on the reins of power, he knew that he had to address one of the two elephants in the crowded metaphorical room - Sergey Bunyachenko. The mouthpiece for the officers. Bunyachenko had been one of Vlasov's competing successors, meaning that he held enough clout and influence to pose a real threat to Zykov's plans, if he so wished. They had scheduled an impromptu meeting with the general, and he was running late.\n\nThe doors creaked open as Bunyachenko ungracefully stepped through. His uniform was dishevelled and his eyes were bloodshot. It looked as if he had been drinking, at the very least just last night, if not into this morning as well. "Good morning, I apologize for my tardiness", Bunyachenko started. "I had lost track of time while I-"\n\nZykov interrupted. "It doesn't matter! We've called you here because we want to discuss your future with the Russian Liberation Army." Bunyachenko's eyes widened. "Don't worry, we're not having you shot."One of the officers chimed in.\n\nZykov glanced at his peer dismissively, before turning to Bunyachenko once more. "No, I suppose we aren't. You represent something that is of value to me, Sergey." Zykov asserted. "You have the ear of the people we need to hear, and who need to be heard by us. The way I see it... we'll keep you around, with a generous salary, and not only will you remain at the head of our armed forces, but you will also report directly to us about any goings on in the army that would need to be reported on. Does that make sense?" A short, curt nod from the general followed, and he was dismissed."

 SAM.19.d:0 ""We all know who he is," Zykov began. "And we all know who's in his pocket."\n\nIt was true. Now that Zykov had assumed control of the Russian Liberation Army, he had real reason to suspect that Mikhail Oktan, a well-known corrupt officer and a reveller in the less-than-savory operations undertaken by some of our soldiers, was one of the driving forces behind the instability following Zykov's ascent to power."But right now, acting against him would be disastrous. The web he's spun himself is far too wide; he controls too much." Zykov concluded, edging out any of his more hawkish supporters in their over-enthusiasm to deal with the individual.\n\n"But that's not to say, of course, that we should merrily leave him to prepare a coup. He operates on a system that centers around his ability to buy his supporters, which means that for a certain price, almost all of them can be bought back. I'd like to have a list drawn up of names that we can convince to come over to us... and a list of those who likely won't be bought, so that we can begin planning arrests of key figures. We may not be able to take him out, yet, but we can whittle him down. Does all of that make sense?"\n\nAides had been busily writing down the chairman's orders, but all nodded in unison as the chairman looked for their understanding. Dismissing themselves, they quickly went to work narrowing down Oktan's supporters and crossing out their lists, name by name."

You've summoned me?" Asked Zykov, sitting down. "That I have. I found myself reflecting on your successful campaign to become Deputy-Chairman. Chairman Vlasov has always spoken well of your ability to inspire and spread a message. These aptitudes will be needed in the coming wars of unification." Zykov frowned slightly, and spoke. "I'm afraid, Deputy-Chairman, that I will be unable to give my full support to the officer's committee and to your program. After all, the democratic ideals I fight for were rejected at the convention. What w-" Bunyachenko cut him off. "Forget idealism. Take a look around, what do you see? Tired men in the officer's committee, unwilling to recognize that half of their staff has been bribed by Oktan. Enemies all around us, plotting to hang us as traitors. Chairman Vlasov, too tired to intervene directly. I know you're not a fool, despite your reputation. I need your help to stave off chaos. There won't be a Russia to spread democracy to if the communists are sitting here next year."\n\nZykov thought for a moment. His eternally confident demeanor did irritate Bunyachenko slightly. Difficult to read what went on behind the man's cheerful mask. Finally Zykov offered his hand for Bunyachenko to shake. "I'll offer what I can. As we both know, I have my own interests, but I think these work out beautifully with yours, Deputy-Chairman." Bunyachenko shook the hand of his new chief propagandist. Hopefully the association would be a profitable one."

"Not striking against Zykov and Commander Bunyachenko?"Oktan smiled, a cloud of smoke drifting through his crooked grin. "Eager to strike so soon against your old boss? Eh, Starikov?" Oktan took a sip of cognac. "They still have their uses, discredited as they are. And they still command significant influence." Another sip.

 SAM.25.d:0 "Despite the selection of Oktan as Deputy-Chairman, and the ensuing morale blow to his own faction of democrats, Miletiy Zykov worked harder than ever. Of course, part of this workload was caused by his ever dwindling staff.\n\nIt felt as if every other day began with a resignation, or its silent equivalent of the staffer simply not appearing for work. Those who had appeared in front of him to hand in their resignation had been gently questioned. Most insisted they were simply retiring from politics. One or two of the honest ones explained that deputy-chairman Oktan had offered a better deal. Land, money, positions of importance, it seemed that the good deputy-chairman never ran out of agreeable rewards for those who befriended him, thought Zykov.\n\nAll this was not good, but it was not extremely bad for the moment. In a way, it was a good thing to see those not entirely dedicated to the cause just up and leave. The remaining core of Zykov's organization would be more motivated than ever to see justice and democracy be restored to Russia. Oktan's constant war on the democratic faction (as well as on the officer's committee, Zykov suspected) would not go unacknowledged however. The former journalist sighed, and picked up the phone. It was time to organize a few meetings of his own. Some of the democratic faction's best assets, after all, did not operate in the light, either."

Deputy-Chairman Oktan returned from the wood and crystal cabinet, holding a bottle of Georgian cognac and two glasses. The dour military officer did not offer any thanks upon being served a glass. He did, to his host's surprise, offer a toast. "To Russia. "To Russia!" Replied Oktan.\n\nBoth men were barely seated when Commander Bunyachenko leaned forward. "Why did you invite me, Deputy-Chairman?" "For a dr-" "Don't even finish that sentence, please." Bunyachenko cut off Oktan. "You are in a position of strength. My organization is not. Have you invited me here to gloat?" Oktan scoffed at the question. "How rude such a thing would be. And besides, why do you speak of your organization, commander Bunyachenko? The officer's committee uses you as a mouthpiece, yes? Because you've been here-to entirely unconcerned with political games of your own."\n\nBunyachenko took a sip of cognac. His expression was still neutral. "Hereto, deputy Chairman?" He finally asked. Oktan laughed pleasantly. "It is no secret that of late you've been dissatisfied with your patrons, and their inability to stand up to me. Why not ditch them? I've use of men who will fight for Russia." The stern officer swirled the cognac around his glass. He finally replied:"What of Zykov's faction?" Oktan laughed again. "They've received a similar offer. I've a need for people who want to fight, commander. The Front, and those idiots in Vyatka, they're tough opposition. We need to come together if we're to win western Russia."\n\nOktan thought he saw the hint of a retort in the other man's eyes. Yet Bunyachenko kept quiet. Emptied his glass. Stood. Finally, he spoke. "My loyalty is to the ROA, its chairman, and its deputy chairman. Thank you for the drink, commander Oktan." He saluted, before leaving the office, without waiting for Oktan's reply."

 SAM.35.d:0 "The sun shone on Vladimir Kirillovich's final day on earth. The prisoner was not melodramatic enough to wish for a storm in his final hours. Such weather might have been more fitting as a coda to a life of exile, leading to war and then a troubled reign in the Russian Anarchy. But the former tsar did not begrudge the weather. It felt good to walk on a sunny day for a final time.\n\nHis thoughts went to other kings, dethroned and killed like common criminals. His would be the fate of Maximilian of Mexico, given at least the honor of a soldier's death against the wall. Better than Louis and Charles, decapitated like common criminals. Far better than his second cousin's death in a stuffy, dark basement lit only by the flash of drunk communist gunmen.\n\nThe sun shone on Samara, but not the warm, pleasant sun of France where he had lived after the revolution. He had never known what to think of the vast skies of Russia he had longed for while in exile. His opinion still eluded him as the soldier brought him to the wall. All around the plaza, scores of citizens of the so called freed Russia looked at him, their emotions as hard to read as Vladimir's own.\n\nGunmen in front of him. Hard to swallow. Vladimir tried to blink away the fear. Thoughts of Leonida, of Maria. Perhaps they had made it to exile. Too late to worry. A wave of flashes, then nothing."

Today would be a day for mourning, for whatever the chairman's faults, he was still the liberator of western Russia. Regardless of whether the people would accept the truth, Miletiy Zykov would have it spoken.\n\nWhen the time came to bury Vlasov, it came on a cold, rainy day. First, there was the procession through Samara, with a guard of honor flanking the general's hearse. Thousands lined the streets, as was their duty, but stayed no longer than expected. Second came the service, after Zykov, Bunyachenko, Oktan and Meandrov bore the coffin up the steps of the rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Savior. All spoke in turn: Meandrov of his victories, Oktan of his strength, Bunyachenko of his dedication. Last was Zykov, who spoke of the general's dream. For a brief few minutes, the officers and civilians packing the pews forgot their treasonous origins, thinking only of the brilliant tapestry woven by the mysterious man from Ukraine.\n\nThe flag of the ROA flew at half-mast from Samara to Arkhangelsk, the blue cross reminding all beneath it of who had given them a second chance at sovereignty. Though they were few, there were those who saluted of their own accord, doffing their hats in a moment of silence for the passing of a humble giant.\n\nMost of Russia would never forgive Andrey Vlasov for his actions. But Zykov, as he sat the general's old office and raised a solitary toast to the old general, expressed his thanks - for standing by his people to the end."

 SAM.38.d:0 "The old man's iron will had given out not too long after the western Russian unification. Aides had found Chairman Vlasov in his room after he had failed to wake up one morning. Three days of mourning had been declared across newly liberated lands. A few genuinely upset citizens had thronged the general's coffin. Vlasov had been admired by a few across Russia. His relentless drive to free Russia from the communist menace had been admired by many. In the dark days of the Western Russian Revolutionary war, areas liberated by the chairman's men had been spared the brutal retribution killing of the Wehrmacht. During the dark decade that followed, he had done as much as possible to shield the people of Samara from his former German backers.\n\nBut the mourners were far outnumbered by a mass of stone-faced civilians. Whether secretly angry or entirely apathetic, General Bunyachenko could not tell. He knew that an overwhelming majority of citizens thought Vlasov the lowest of lowest in all of Russian history. A pathetic dog of the German occupier, that had led Russian troops in a fratricidal war to crush the resurgent Red army. Soldiers with live ammunition had covered the funeral procession, lest rioters try to smash the old Chairman's coffin.\n\nReading a hastily prepared speech, Bunyachenko felt out of his element, standing as he did in front of the sea of blank faces. He had always wondered why the detested Vlasov had lived day after day in hope of redemption. Now the wave of cold contempt threatened to drown KONR's new leader. Russia stood on the brink of unification for the first time in decades. A fact one could hardly imagine from the assembled citizen, too tired even for despair at the take-over of their land by former German collaborators.\n\nBunyachenko mumbled the last few words of the funerary oration. His officer colleagues led the applause. With one last look at Vlasov, the new leader of liberated western Russia marched off the podium. His wish to be alone for the rest of the day would go unfulfilled."

Of course, Oktan was ostensibly in the office by sheer coincidence when the news broke, but that wasn't quite true. He did have a good reason for being there, however - a vital mission, one more step in the liberation of Russia!\n\nAnd so, Oktan slipped a lockpick from his pocket and set about liberating Vlasov's personal effects. The new chairman's grin widened as he yanked the first drawer open and saw the treasures within: a shiny Luger, a gift from some bribed German officer; an assortment of Soviet medals, stashed away in shame; ah, and some Vyatka vodka! Oktan took a swig, savoring the smoothness, then noticed the finest prize of all.\n\nA fat, crisp wad of Reichsmarks, several thousand at least. The last of his pay packets from the West Russian War, presumably. Oktan flicked through the notes, then raised them to his nose and inhaled deeply. There was nothing better than the clean, promising smell of German-minted currency on a sad day such as this.\n\nOktan quickly set about stuffing as much as he could carry into the pockets of his overcoat - and then paused. In all the excitement, he'd quite forgotten what Vlasov's passing meant. Chairman... Chairman Oktan. It had a nice ring to it. It was the ring of gold against silver, of fine crystal glasses being set before him and filled with Breton wine. Smiling again, he resumed his inveterate looting.

That successor has been informed of Vlasov's passing, and the continuity and transition procedures previously written by Vlasov's office have been put into effect.\n\nA complicated man, Vlasov leaves behind an equally complicated legacy of both collaboration as well as liberation, and it is not clear how his past actions will be remembered in future years. Regardless of such future perceptions however, the state he founded in the aftermath of the West Russian War provided us with the foundation necessary to achieve regional unification, and this should not, and will not, be forgotten.\n\nVlasov's successor now faces the daunting task of not only strengthening our control over a region where many perceive us as illegitimate, but also preparing us for the conflicts to come as we pursue our ultimate goal of liberating all the peoples of Russia - from Europe to the Far East.\n\nWe hope they rise to meet the challenge."

There are also tensions brewing in ethnic minority areas. Many locals see the death of General Vlasov as a signal of internal weaknesses within our government.\n\nThis angry rabble may be more correct than it suspects, as our military position is failing in many districts. The death of Commander Vlasov has sparked a storm of rumors that has now descended upon both our soldiers and our officers. Some units refuse our orders, claiming that your position as chairman is illegitimate. Other garrisons have simply gone silent, failing to reply to our transmissions.\n\nAll hope is not yet lost, chairman. It is likely that much of the confusion within our ranks can be dispelled by loyalist units. We can address discontent amongst the troops with minor reforms: Such as increased pay or longer permissions now that the wars of unification are complete. As to the remaining mutineers, they will be crushed, and their sponsors will be smoked out.\n\nWe will make sense of this situation."

 SAM.43.t:0 "By the People"
 SAM.43.desc:0 ""For are we all not brothers, struggling together for unification? Have we not fought, shoulder to shoulder, side by side, in the trenches for years? If you lay down your guns now, our movement will be saved and no one will be hurt, I can promise that much. Remember, men, struggle not against your family, but against those who wish to take it away!"\n\nToday, Zykov took to the air to announce the end of the mutinies and to encourage the few still in arms to give up, offering amnesty to all those who were not directly involved in instigating the mutiny. The path to end the mutiny and prevent the implosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to perfectly recall the tenets that Macchiavelli preached centuries ago. Zykov had bribed all who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those could not be satisfied with either. The combination worked, if only barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and an aura of relief brough by them, were swirling around the heads of the committee which Zykov now stood in front of. The enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing on the situation and it's fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. "As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized and financed this mutiny against the authority of our dear chairman." For most, that was a surprise. The truth of the situation was that Oktan had nothing to do with the revolt - but Zykov knew an opportunity when he saw one. "Indeed it is clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate rat-like insubordinates in our ranks, no matter how entrenched in favors they may be." Zykov looked around this room, his cool gaze analyzing each member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. "Very well. If it is the will of the committee, and our dear chairman, I will gladly order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial."\n\nOktan would not, in fact, get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, summarily being shot. His body was burned in the hut's backyard, and that was the end of Mikhail Oktan."

 SAM.44.desc:0 "Outside of a small village about two and a half hour's drive from the city of Samara lay, in a pile, roughly thirty dead bodies. Well over half of them were wearing the ROA's uniform, the other dead were clearly partisans. The confrontation between the partisans and the local patrol had taken place when a routine inspection of the village led to the discovery of weapons caches, partisans hiding in plain sight. The firefight that ensued saw all of the partisans killed, but most of the patrol as well. The dead ROA, which featured kids as young as sixteen, was sorted into one pile, with another, far more uncouth, for the dead partisans, mostly young men and women. Vlasov, who was shocked to hear that there was such a coherent piece of communist resistance so close to the capital, drove out himself to see the aftermath. Accompanied by two of his bodyguards, he examined the carnage after personally ordering the surviving patrol members to not exact revenge on the surviving villagers. One of the bodyguards, Belochkin, was a personal confidant of the old general. He could tell that for the first time in a long time, Vlasov was filled with emotion - and none of it was good. His mouth formed into a tight-lipped grimace as he walked through the village. An explosion of anger eventually brought the usually laconic general into a yelling fit, shouting at the pile of dead partisans. "Who are you to think that you could do what you tried to do?" He asked and then paused. Was he waiting for a response? "I have worked years - no, decades - to bring about a Russia free from communism, free from tyranny. And all you people who so stubbornly resist my efforts, indoctrinated by the bastards I beat years ago, you waste the lives of brave, young men who fight my good fight!" Belochkin was stunned. He looked around, villager and soldier alike froze, observing the marshal's outburst. Glancing towards his fellow bodyguard, he slowly approached Vlasov, who had since fallen silent. Careful not to touch him, Belochkin quietly whispered in his ear. "Perhaps, my chairman, it is time for us to go. I'm sure you're needed back in Samara." Vlasov weakly agreed; the drive back to the capital was a very quiet one."

In bad times, Zykov's steely determination explained how the long suffering democratic faction had weathered ten years of abuse from various factions in Samara.\n\nToday's Zykov reminded Bunyachenko of seeing himself in a mirror. The former journalist did not walk into the office so much as he tumbled in, pushed around by the weight of events.\n"Zykov. Good to see you." The democratic activist began to speak, only for the chairman to cut him off. "No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress. The officer's committee believes that Oktan is behind everything that's happening right now in the army and the liberated territories. You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces."\n"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the officer committee? I should go see them directly"\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. "The officer committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized. I'm in the market for new... associates."\nZykov's eyes shone a little brighter. Or had it been just an illusion?

The officers and those judged too radical had been kept on death's row long enough for fellow travellers to the other side to arrive. ROA officers all, corrupt to the bone and kindling for rebellion to a man.\n\nOne of the officers had not travelled far to meet his fate. Hours before recapturing the village, orders had come through for the man's arrest. Citing his insubordination and corruption, the men from Bunyachenko's entourage had relieved the commander of his post and tossed him into a holding cell. None among the soldiers doubted his guilt. The astute few noted the disgraced officer's tie to Oktan's faction. These were bad days for ambitious men within the army of liberation that did not bend the knee to the officer's committee.\n\nSedated by defeat and by an extra set of emergency rations, the villagers crowded mutely around the execution grounds.

The pair were both prominent members of the Russian Liberation Army's Officer Committee that Bunyachenko chaired, and despite Oktan's ascension as chairman of the liberation army, had both remained at his side despite the former's attempts at curbing or buying the Committee's power.\n\nBoth were oddly silent this morning, however, as Bunyachenko attempted to brainstorm ways to counter Oktan's influence. "It spreads like a cancer, Arkady..." he said, frustrated with his inability to stop the cretin. "He buys who he buys, and it seems like nowadays everyone has their price." The usually-loquacious Popov seemed dismal, while Antonov, ever the deadpan figure, remained steel-faced. "Well?" asked Bunyachenko. "What do we do now?"\n\nPopov nervously checked his watch, and was about to answer when a sharp rap at the door interrupted him. Before Bunyachenko could even ask who was interrupting him, four of his personal guards entered, their weapons drawn.

Together, and under the command of those who had recruited them, he and other volunteers in the militia soon found themselves equipped with surprisingly modern weapons and tasked with holding the city centre against a Vlasovite formation.\n\nMaksim was surprised at how easy it was. The Vlasovites seemed disunited, and he was certain that he had heard shots from their positions, down the street from his own barricade. As the days passed, however, he grew confused. Why wasn't the militia advancing? Why was the commander, the man who had spoken so passionately about revolt and had somehow secured such high-quality weapons, now just sitting in the command post?\n\nHis confusion was only heightened when the commander suddenly ordered them to stockpile their weapons and assemble in formation before himself and his hand-picked officers. And then, as a car drove up and a man emerged, a man Maksim recognized as the local black marketeer and a functionary of the hated General Oktan, it all became, at last and far, far too late, abundantly clear.\n\nA satchel was handed to the commander, the commander gestured to his officers, and the officers raised their weapons. Maksim managed only a half-step before the bullet pierced his skull. Six hours later Maksim's body joined those of his compatriots in a mass grave as the black marketeer looked on, pleased with the success of his own small part in General Oktan's plot to distract and occupy the army. He wondered how much he would be paid.\n\nHe knew the amount would be generous. The General always was."

Now mutinous soldiers and rebellious civilians alike had been dealt with. Discontent was once more forced to lurk in the shadow.\n\nThe soldier sat by the ashes and picked up one of the potatoes. Still warm to the touch. Nikolai was grateful for the attention of his comrades. He ate in silence, rifle on his lap. Out in the valley below most lights blinked out for the night. Electricity was still a rarity, and candles an important necessity in a now peaceful Russia. Perhaps peace would bring more light.\n\nThe soldier picked up the other potato, and stood up.

Sobol was a man of the military, ultimately, and his assignment to meet with the American Central Intelligence Agency was because, years ago, he had experience dealing with Soviet intelligence. "An oxymoron, I know", he liked to joke with other ROA members. But there was nothing humorous in the man who sat at a table in the back, poorly illuminated by a combination of candles and old lights. He had a grizzled look about him, a man who clearly hadn't gotten a chance to shave in a few days, some rough scruff growing into a full-fledged beard. As he approached the table, the individual looked up, and slowly rose, shaking Sobol's hand.\n\n"Utkin". He introduced himself in flawless Russian, albeit with the accent of an English speaker. "Parents fled the revolution", he explained further, referencing the Soviets. "Grew up speaking Russian at home, English in school. It's good to meet you, Colonel Maksimov."\n\n'Maksimov?' Thought Sobol. The other man thought he was speaking to Sobol's commanding officer. "Major Sobol, actually. Colonel Maksimov is my superior", the Russian officer responded, taking a seat across from Utkin, trying to ignore the look of disappointed disinterest in the spook's expression. "It's good to finally sit down with you, and discuss our future with America".\n\n"And what future would that be, major?" the agent responded.\n\nThe question took Sobol aback - he had barely been briefed on the meeting, outside of the fact of who he was meeting and what they were discussing. That much became obvious when Sobol stumbled over his words. "Ah, well, recognition. Support-", Sobol responded. As he attempted to go on, he was interrupted by the American.\n\n"Listen. Not that anyone's asking me, but I don't really care about your organization's reputation. I think you're doing God's work. But some of my higher-ups don't feel the same. A lot of the CIA remembers your organization as it was years ago. My being on the ground here doesn't change that. Between you and me?" Utkin leaned in. "You guys have a lot of rebranding to do. Until then, it's going to be very hard for me to convince my handlers of anything."\n\nSobol attempted to protest.\n\n"Isn't it clear that we're not interested in collaboration anymore? It was only ever a means to an end. Believe me, our leaders are planning retribution against the Germans on a massive scale".\n\nIt was no use, however.

However, Mikhail Oktan was far from the typical statesman. He revelled in the shadows, likening himself to a puppet master at play, jangling around those who he bought or blackmailed as if they were marionettes, setting up corrupt deals and meeting wealthy magnates. In a dingy, run-down bar, where Oktan frequently held court, the type of place where you had to take three alleys from the main street to get there, a special session was taking place.\n\nEver since he had attained his position at the top of the ROA's leadership, Oktan had been frequenting his old contacts less and less, relying on his more trusted and thuggish cronies to tie up loose ends and ensure both compliance and loyalty among those who still had their uses. However, music played loudly, and the raucous nature of his little backalley hideaway betrayed his presence. Sitting at his table that he had specifically made up for himself, seemingly sitting court among the bar patrons, and flanked on all sides by the scariest bodyguards he could buy, Oktan faced a trio of less-than-savoury Russians who lived beyond the Urals. The three men called themselves the Goncharov Brothers, and while none of them were related, each one was nastier than the next. One, a trader from Nizhny Novgorod who dabbled in less savory trades than guns, the second an ashamed "made man" from the thief's territory, and the third a disgraced middling officer from the city of Tyumen accused by Kaganovich's commissars as corrupt. Each one of them had fled from their lives, fleeing stark justice, only to redefine themselves as smugglers who worked for the most powerful, or anyone else who would pay more. The trio had made their first fortune smuggling contraband eastwards, across the Urals. They were still under his employ, but they had been called to talk to the new Grand Marshal, now that he was fully in control of Western Russia. After ensuring that all three of them had some of the nicest vodka in the joint, Oktan opened. \n"Gentlemen. I'm sure that all three of you have heard about my promotion."\n"But of course, Grand Marshal. A big step up, that's for sure." the man from Tyumen stated.\n"Then I won't have to remind you of how important you are to me... now more than ever.

But as the Russian states began to coalesce, its "importance", if it ever had one, was beginning to be forgotten. It had been a key location for an anti-ROA revolt by old-time Pro-Soviet guerrillas, unwilling to accept the primacy of the ROA. As such the village and its inhabitants were treated incredibly harshly when the counterrevolutionary army swept in and slaughtered the partisans that resisted them. The winds of change were clearly afoot, however. An ROA soldier nailed an announcement on the dilapidated bulletin board in the center of the town. As he slunked off, the villagers who had seen him putting up the announcement quickly gathered around the piece of paper, expecting more bad news. They would be surprised - "Martial law to end in one week", the pamphlet claimed. "Village council rule to resume the following". The group was positively shocked as the announcement continued to detail the reach of council rule - which had never been witnessed in Shuvaya - as well as the various responsibilities and powers that were associated with the councils. The pamphlet described council rule as a contract between the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia and each individual village council, where both worked to better themselves and the nation. It was a surprisingly fair deal for the Shuvayan peasants, who had so far been poorly treated by the ROA.\n\nSome of the most skeptical thought that it was a trap - but it became clear that the order was genuine in a week's time when, true to their word, the local ROA garrison withdrew from the town and ended martial law. As the last truck drove down the dirt path back towards civilization, the people of Shuvaya found themselves, temporarily, without government. It was a strange feeling, even for the youngest of villagers. For the first time in a long time, there was peace, they had just been willingly granted autonomy by the soldiers that they once hated. Like a deer in headlights, the people seemed to be stunned. But that very afternoon a group of the most experienced, and, in general, the oldest residents of the village set up a council to prepare themselves for self-government. This council would become one of hundreds, varying in size and importance, to be created by Zykov's relaxation of emergency rule."

Their replacements had been hand picked by chairman Bunyachenko.\n\nThe chairman himself was a different man.

A quiet and respected officer, but not one to show any initiative. Nowadays, determination had replaced melancholy in the general's posture.\n\nRumors circulated of the Chairman calling for a constitutional convention. Many in the old officer's clique assumed this would be the perfect opportunity to present a shopping list to commander Bunyachenko to make the officer's committee eternally important in the new era.

The beast had seen the chaos of the 50's, survived the West Russian War, was captured three different times by three different warlords, before finally ending up in the reserve arsenal of the Russian Liberation Army. It had been doled out to Vadim Kovalevsky so that he and the garrison that was assigned to him could make their way to Yerykly. Kovalevsky, a junior officer of the ROA, was quickly bought by Oktan soon after he received his post, mostly because of Kovalevsky's drinking problem and penchant for violence where needed. He played his role during the tumultuous time between Vlasov's death and Oktan's assumption of power, and because of that, he had been parcelled out a small village and its environs as a reward. Kovalevsky, poorly read and fat off of the luxuries provided by his master, was more than happy, after a few vodkas, of course, to accept the "gift" that Oktan had provided him. The sobering reality of the situation only set in when he was woken up the next morning and told that he was to report to his new fiefdom.\n\nYerykly was a village where the primary export was poverty. The streets were dirt on a good day, mud on most, and the most exciting thing that had happened here since the end of the terror bombings was that one of the cows had given birth to twins. Now, Kovalevsky, who had grown up a refugee from the Germans to the West of Samara, knew desperate times. As he stepped off of his troop truck, he found his welcome completely ignored by most of the village's inhabitants, who continued on with their daily lives. Kovalevsky had a flash, for just a brief moment - the place, somehow, reminded him of home. But as reality sank in, he knew that the relative comfort of Samara was long behind him, and his faint smile turned to grimace. The only consolation that he had was, for now, this entire village lived and died on his decree."

 SAM.56.desc:0 "The Constitutional Convention for the Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia was of utter chaos - Zykov hadn't just invited important ROA magnates, but also hardcore democrats, some of whom were former members of the Komi Republic, ex-Tsarists who had operated under Vladmir III's controversial regime, cautious reformers, drawn from both Zykov's supporters and beyond. He had, perhaps most controversially, invited a series of left-leaning politicians as well - those who had definitely been members of the CPSU at one point or another, some of whom even utterly refused to renounce their allegiance to a leftist ideology. The convention - attended by 59 members plus Zykov himself, had been passionately arguing with itself for quite some time. Not just over the nature of the constitution, but the future of Russia as a whole. The only thing that kept the delegates in check were reminders that their participation was contingent on keeping the convention civil, as well as the several armed ROA guards that lined the large conference room. Zykov intermittently participated, but also went about various other duties of state as well, and was thus often absent for a lot of the debates. In his stead, a secretary took what notes he could and sent them off for review by the chairman. Additionally, any changes or proposed clauses to be put in to the constitution were brought to Zykov personally, in front of the convention, where he would give his often-critical opinion on the proposed additions, which tended to be well received by the voting members of the convention - especially considering how many of the delegates were suspiciously oft in agreement with Zykov's "decrees", as some more independent-minded delegates began to seethingly call them.\n\nZykov read over the newest proposed provision for the constitution. Clearly, it had been drafted by the convention's more radical elements - the words that stood out to him were "fully representative democracy". The entire clause called for that and more. Something that Zykov was personally not interested in, but also that even considering implementing something like that would not only alienate the officers of the ROA, but perhaps even induce them to revolt. A dangerous consideration for the chairman who often felt he walked a razor's edge. "This part here, it's unacceptable to the convention. Democracy indeed, but the term "fully representative" cannot be expected within the realities of Russia." And with that, the provision was discarded, the convention continued their bickering."

To do this, they relied on the Chairman's favor. After all, had Bunyachenko not been a creature of the committee all these years?\n\nThe chairman grimaced.

The ROA did not scale well to its new role as both army and government of an entire nation. Bunyachenko had called on industrialists, on mayors and commune leaders, on lower ranking ROA officers to attend the convention as part of his coalition.

Decked in the traditional ROA's officer garb and a dark grey trench coat draped over his shoulders, the medals that he had awarded himself seemed comically large on his chest. He shook hands and saluted all of those who greeted him, and espoused his charismatic, dynamic exterior for the whole convention to see. It almost seemed more a procession than an entrance, but after all, the Grand Marshal did preside over the convention. As he took his place at the front of the gathered delegates, he observed those who had earned a place at the convention: from the military wing, his most trusted and skilled generals, those who had earned a place at the Grand Marshal's side. Beside them sat the more junior officers, the ones that he couldn't name, but that he, and his trusted senior comrades, had seen fit to bestow administrative responsibilities to large tracts of land in Western Russia. He may not have known their names, but clearly their hearts were in the right place. Next to them sat the noticeably smaller civilian wing. These were the real question marks in Oktan's mind - he had his trusted aides put feelers out in Samara and other large cities under the control of the KONR for any "dynamic individual" who had the money, manpower, and desire to cooperate closely with the Grand Marshal and his plans for the future. These were industrialists, technocrats, disgraced former politicians. Each one of them with an interest and, to Oktan, a payoff. Looking over all those assembled, Oktan began to talk, his raspy, but powerful voice booming through the room, made louder by the ancient microphone he was speaking into. "My friends, thank you for joining me here today, in the true spirit of a Russian state!" Respectful clapping followed, before he continued. "As most of you know, we all have been working tirelessly to forge a Russia independent of the communists, who have been doing nothing but causing issues for our land for decades. With this convention, we have taken a massive step towards destroying their movement completely. And once we do, we can begin looking at turning our Russia into a rich nation... one where all will be without want, free to help forge a strong identity and forever prevent the slide of our people back into the depravity of communism.

It was made public that in both federal and provincial courts, that there would be a mixture of civilian and military judges, the latter only making up about a third of the judiciary. The move was controversial, but ultimately in line with the Chairman's vision for a democratic Russia that prioritized the needs of its citizenry. Zykov, still always careful to walk the razor's edge between his vision and the military's reactionism, ensured that those appointed to their respective positions, civilian or military, were in his pocket. That way, at the very least, they could make their case for Zykov and defend his choices to their respective supporters. Of course, the civilian judges and the military judges both had their own agendas - after all, everyone wanted something. But the aim was that, despite their affiliation, they would remain loyal to the Chairman.\n\n"Welcome to your new office, judge". Anatoly Ignatov's brother said, emphasizing his new title as the pair of them entered into the large room. A comfortable area, the office would be the headquarters for Ignatov's new job - that of judge. He had been handpicked by the ROA following the chairman's insistence on forming a coherent and comprehensive judiciary. Despite the fact that he was a civilian, he met with Zykov's deputies, who, apparently, were enamored with the now-judge's ideas of justice and sensibility. Of course, the position wasn't without responsibilities, nor was Ignatov's conscience clean; the former community leader did have to make some deals with the deputies to ensure that he got the position. This of course, included an unspoken provision that he was to be loyal to the chairman, and by extension, the entire committee. But this was a small price to pay for the position that he now found himself in. As he explored the room, his brother, in awe at the place, asked him a question. "So where will you start?

He couldn't possibly postpone the meeting of prominent military and civilian officials to finalize the judiciary system in the Provisional Commissariat. Especially, as the aide had pointed out, that the officers who he was meeting with, he had sent them out to their fiefs but had so soon recalled them.

So, let's get down to business, shall we?" He asked those gathered, laziness rapidly dissipating in favour of excitement. The Grand Marshal laid out a number of documents, which were passed around the group. "As you can see, we're looking at a dual military-civilian system. The military governor of a province appoints a political chief, which deals with any civilian case in the district, but can be appealed or vetoed by the military governor. Cases won't be able to be taken federally, the military governor is the highest say." Oktan shifted in his chair, looking more towards the officers. "Military disputes will be handled federally. A group of officers will serve in positions as judges and will be handpicked by me. A judge can be removed if the majority of the judges vote them off, or if I want them off. I'd pick a successor.

The reaction to this announcement was mixed among the people of Russia. In places like Samara, which had known ROA rule for so long, it was a welcome relief to military rule, and Yedinstvo, the political party representing the ROA, candidates were projected to win in landslides. In other places, the news of elections were more tentative. The gentry of Syktyvkar, those who survived its conquest, were cynical and suspicious of the elections, and immediately pointed out the great degree of gerrymandering that had gone on in certain areas. This gerrymandering, likely, they claimed, all but ensured the victory of the Yedinstvo in various areas to make sure that its interests were represented in the government. But Zykov's official representatives denied this claim vehemently. In the north, where the Soviet remnants once reigned supreme, feelings were ambivalent. For the ideological hardliners, those who fled with the front, rigorous campaigning for candidates as left as was allowed occurred, but many others, natives, cared little.

Portraits of great Russians, including Oktan himself, adorned the walls, but there was a conspicuous lack of Vlasov's presence.

"Look at your face!" the Grand Marshal cackled. "No, no, nothing like that..." He said, calming himself down after a fit of laughter. "The Committee would like you to... well, grant you the governorship of the province of Nizhny Novgorod!" Lagunov, clearly not having recovered from the fright, wasn't quite sure what to say. "A... a governorship?" He repeated. Oktan rolled his eyes. "Come now, don't be so suspicious. Is this because of the joke? I'm sorry. Yes, we want you to govern the region. You'll be subject to the federal government, of course, which means that you'll owe taxes, as well as conscription and equipment levies. But you can make your own laws, within reason of course, so long as they only apply within the borders of the area that you control! How's that sound?"\n\nThe colonel was taken aback. He had been smart enough to keep his head down during Oktan's accession, but he had never expected this. "I... well, I must accept." Lagunov took a drink with the officers for the first time in a long time, and he left the "meeting" satisfied, knowing that he would be presiding over his hometown."

Are there any questions?"\n\nThe Perm Armaments Factory no.32 opened today, as one of many government-controlled enterprises that did the same under Zykov's dual public-private sector industrial policy. This factory, like its sister facilities all across the territory of the Provisional Commissariat, would be working day-in and day-out to produce weapons and ammunition for the ever-hungry ROA. Owned and operated by the government, these arms factories, once seen as a dreadful deal by a number of local residents, had become beacons of job stability and good pay as a result of government investment into making working conditions and wages livable, at the very least. Zykov had worked for a long time to ensure a good, stable industrial base for the ROA back when it was scratching out a meager existence around Samara, and later once he was the guiding hand behind Vlasov's policies. Now that he was at the helm of the Provisional Commissariat, a coherent, effective, and most importantly, fair, industrial policy had been put in place by Zykov and his administration. The military industry would be almost entirely state-controlled: The line between the military-industrial sector and the ROA itself seemed to be distinct, if blurry at times. This way the state could guide the necessities of military production while also ensuring that the needs of the soldiers are met. The civilian sector, however, was almost immediately privatised. The government sold off a number of factories that had been seized during the ROA's conquest of Western Russia, and those they couldn't sell, they simply handed out to conglomerates and corporations. Working conditions were exponentially better than they had been a mere few years ago, and while a civilian factory job was far from perfect, it was, at least, stable."

The new Chairman, however, silenced the feverish complaints that such a project could not be realized. Had the Japanese not carved an empire of steel in Manchuria where once only dusty steppe could be found? Had not the damn Bukharinists developed the central Siberian heavy industry in such a time span?\n\nCombining a modern central financial system and interlocking shareholders, a select set of industrial concerns would be expanded horizontally and vertically into economical juggernauts dubbed kombinats. The presence of allies of the government in key financial institutions would be used to feed loyal businesses, and prevent hostile takeovers by national or international rivals. In preparation for liberation of the rest of Russia, military supplying contracts would provide initial fuel for the rise of these kombinats.\n\nBunyachenko's speech concluded, the chairman stood and answered questions.

The only exception to that was the Republic of Zlatoust, but even then their merchants tended to keep all non-essential information close to their chest. However, as proto-states coalesced in Western Russia and east of the Urals, it became increasingly inevitable that there would be communication and interaction between the two areas.

The pair, alongside the rest of their squad, had finally been taken off of frontline action in a standard troop rotation, and Volkov found himself oddly empty. To his surprise, he had enjoyed his time on the frontlines, even during the bloody unification wars against the Tsarists, communists, and others. He had felt a pride in his chest, as if he was doing something good for the first time in his life, and that he was working towards something greater than himself. But rearguard duty was sort of boring to the young corporal. As he pulled off his new boots, he noted how much comfier they were than the ones he had been issued when he first joined up. Storing his assault rifle, he recalled the days when he had been given: a German-made Kar98k, the bolt of which seemed to jam after every other shot. Now what he - and his entire squad, for that matter - were issued could seemingly be dragged through the mud and still work. The changes were incredibly apparent for the young man, who had witnessed vast change in his relatively short tenure. As he sat back down on his bunk, Pavlovsky, across from him, was reading. With change in his mind, he asked the grizzled veteran, "Say, Pavlovsky, what do you think of everything that's changed?"\nA small grin crept over Pavlovsky's face as he turned his head to face Volkov and closed his book. "I think that the changes are pretty crazy. If you told me, three year ago, that I'd be sitting here with a belly full of food, clothes that haven't been worn by three other people before me, and a gun that works, I'd have told you that you're crazy". The man was notoriously laconic, but Volkov always pressed him for more. "Have you ever seen anything like this before? I mean... When the army was forced to fight with the Germans". \nSilence, before Pavlovsky's response came. "Oh, God, I can't remember, it seems". He ran a hand through his silver scruff. "I can barely even remember the equipment they gave us. The missions we were given. Complete suicide, they were. You'd be lucky to get their assault rifle, the StG. Usually you'd have old rifles, the ones that... I guess their own soldiers couldn't use?" There was a pause, the old soldier sighing. "There are so few of us left from then.

This informal network, known as the "Shepchushchaya Galereya", or whispering gallery, had become the paramount organization for intelligence gathering and dissention prevention. Zykov knew that it was indispensable, and the sheer size of both the Galereya's agents and the territory they now had to cover essentially warranted by necessity its reformation into an official, government-sanctioned agency: The Ministry of Truth. From the lowliest soldier to some of the highest ranking officials in Zykov's realm, suddenly, as informants, they found themselves under the scrutiny of a new set of handlers, professionally and deftly collecting information and dispensing rewards as needed.\n\nCorporal Gennady Bogomolov sat in a barren office, nervously smoking. The young soldier, having willingly joined the ROA not too long ago, had already begun a seemingly-meteoric rise through the ranks due to his loyalty and leadership qualities. But it was just that loyalty that had caused himself to wander into the office of Leonid Viktorov, the local Ministry of Truth political officer. Bogomolov watched Viktorov, the officer's back to him, as he searched his records for two specific names. It was clear Viktorov was no soldier - longer hair, a scruffy beard, and, while hardly noticeable to the untrained eye, a small pot belly that betrayed the luxury that he had known. However, the bureaucrat-turned-agent's reputation for making Zykov's problems go away had preceded him. There were even rumors flying around the NCOs that if Viktorov arrived at your barracks, it was because he was planning to clean house. But Viktorov had been with Bogomolov's garrison for over a week and no arrests nor executions had come. "You did the right thing, coming to me about this", Viktorov said, still leaning over his files, before eventually picking a pair of them up and sliding them across the table. "It's these two you were speaking of, correct?" Personnel files on two separate soldiers who had been on the pay of Oktan were shown to Bogomolov. The corporal took a long drag from his cigarette. "Yes, these two. What'll happen to them?" Viktorov smiled an empty smile. "That's for me to worry about. You're dismissed. And ah, before you go", the officer continued, pulling out a pack of Bogomolov's favourite obscure cigarettes and passing them to him. "Remember to choose your friends carefully".

A combination of brutality, shrewd business dealings, and pure luck had propelled Valvov into the position of something resembling a middleman in the western Urals. Regardless, he had been recruited by Oktan some years back - the man paid well in both money and influence. "God only knows how many times the man's bailed me out of tricky situations..." the smuggler muttered to himself as he walked into a nondescript apartment building.\n\nReviewing the evidence that he had in mind and in document, he walked into the local branch of what Oktan called his "Ministry of Truth". All very official, the "ministry", which was as cloak and dagger as Valvov remembered from Oktan, contained only a few employees. After a cursory search for weapons and an explanation of who he was, Valvov sat down and explained what he had seen: He had to pay his way through a local checkpoint after a pair of particularly loud-mouthed ROA soldiers had blocked his way. Irritated by the fee, he noticed that the two of them had been complaining about how "arbitrary" some of Oktan's policies were.\n\nValvov, ever the diligent friend of the Grand Marshal, had done some digging, greased the palms of those who needed to be greased, and he had uncovered a ring of dissenters among some of the newer ROA officers - the ones that had been hurriedly promoted and pressed into service in and around the city of Syktyvkar - who had been planning some sort of mutiny against the more loyal members of Oktan's crew. The local minister, who had never introduced himself, nodded his head knowingly as Valvov disclosed what he had discovered, even going so far as judiciously examining the evidence that the smuggler had compiled for him. After nodding approvingly, the officer opened a drawer and threw a wad of cash on the table. "Thanks for this, we'll take care of it going forward.

His family had lived in a relatively large town, and as it was taken by the ROA, it seemed that their rule would be more of the same. Martial law, restrictions on gatherings and what people could do. But as their victory became more assured, it seemed as if their grip on the town slipped. It was a deceptive slipping, of course - as peace returned to Western Russia, Zykov's armed forces helped transition their new state from military to civilian rule . Village and town councils were introduced, and state-run schools with state-issued curricula were opened. Attendance was made mandatory for all children.\n\n"The October Revolution - what do we know about it?" asked the school teacher, whose name Viktor could barely remember. In fact, he couldn't remember when last he had been up this early. Early morning lessons were tough, and made worse by the fact that both his parents, who needed to work long days, would drop him off to the new school early so that they would be able to make it to their jobs on time. Another child, one likely more diligent than Viktor answered. "That it overthrew the Tsar?" he asked. "That's not exactly correct, but close. The Tsar was removed before the revolution". It was clear that she was looking for a specific answer. One, much to her chagrin, wouldn't be granted. After a period of silence, the teacher, with some marked disappointment on her face, imparted the knowledge that she had wanted to hear upon the apparently-hapless schoolchildren.

It's true, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for most of them, and would prepare them for the new Russia that Oktan had envisioned. However, truthfully, conditions were terrible, and the curriculum was more than controversial, even for the deplorable state of the Russian educational system.\n\nThe hours in class were almost as long as the hours in a factory, and discipline was harsh. Obedience was taught above all - the teachers were all uniformed and ranked the children based on their performance, engagement, and obedience.

In truth, the Russia that Zykov had begun to shape was one of relative freedom - elections, a liberalized economy, apart from the arms manufacturing sector, and a relatively fair judiciary.

As such, there are permanent efforts to assess the loyalty of each militia, placing men of our democratic faction as officers in as many militia as we can.\n\nIt would certainly be a tragedy if we had to field loyal militias against rogue military elements, or vice versa.

Zykov and his deputies have done well to curtail the most dangerous and extremist political elements, and the rest are a cluster of irrelevant nobodies divided over ridiculous sectarian concerns. Amid this electoral jungle, a man of vision has emerged. Nikolay Rumyantsev, a colorful character with a colorful past, having fought for both Free France and the Tsar, has declared in his newly minted paper, the creation of his own party.\n\nThe Russian Movement of Democratric Reform is a coalition of various liberal and democratic factions that are committed to the continued republicalizing of Russia. This center-left organization, having managed to squirm its way out from under Zykov's suppression of the Left, has laid itself plainly into the public eye. Rumyantsev has presented a platform that has proven appealing to the people of the republic, promising to work to ban voter suppression and extend the vote to émigrés. Zykvov has considered the situation carefully. Rumyantsev was a transplant from Vyakta, though he had since sworn off Tsarism. The journalist knew all coalitions were delicate things, especially considering the one he had been a part of in the early days when Russia was merely Samara. This new liberal opposition party would no doubt struggle to thrive in Russia's carefully managed democracy."

Even the presence of trusted men such as the village's priest did not inspire much confidence.\n\nEventually a first test of the new legal structure presented itself. A young man had allegedly been found rummaging through a neighbor's pantry, and had taken a bullet in the back for his trouble. The youth had survived, and his family were now accusing their neighbors of attempted murder. The accused had asked the tribunal's help, as few believed his side of the story. Better risk the military's justice than wait out a lynching.\n\nThe military officer acting as judge did a commendable job of patiently taking on both sides of the story. The jury of four soldiers and five civilians then adjusted for deliberations. A non-guilty verdict for the accused was reached. The judge then imposed on the man a few weeks of community service, as well as a fine meant to pay for the care of the injured youth.\n\nAll across Samara, a range of issues began having their day in court. From criminal cases to perfectly mundane administrative topics, agreements and rulings were handed out.

 SAM.301.desc:0 "Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov. The name bounced around the aide's head. Vlasov had been long silent about a potential political successor for him in the case of his death or incapacitation. However, it was obvious to everyone who was anyone in the ROA that the chairman wasn't getting any younger. But Zykov? Certainly an unorthodox choice. Vlasov had convened an emergency meeting of all of his aides nearly half an hour ago to make a preliminary announcement to them. But the announcement had turned into a discussion - the move was shocking to a number of the more conservative aides, who thought that the transition to Zykov would be a disaster. Truthfully, Vlasov was an alright boss. An aide never had to fear reprisals for small mistakes, like they did under many other senior officers. All were free to express their opinions there, so long as they were respectful. Luchenko, one of the aide's peers, voiced his. "Zykov's gone as far as proposing the reinstitution of democracy, but the people know nothing of democracy. Most don't care. Will they even understand what that would mean? I worry that all we have worked to build will devolve into the chaos that we've heard is going on in Syktyvkar". The field marshal retorted in a tired but firm tone. "Zykov may want democracy, Luchenko, but have we not been working towards a free Russia? What Russia is free but does not allow the people freedom?" There was silence for a bit. Another aide, one of Luchenko's good friends, finally spoke up. "But, and if I may, there are some doubts that some of the staff have about Zykov's true intentions. Even if he were to... assume power... after you..." The aide seemed to stumble. "Some worry that he doesn't even believe in democracy, and will attempt to use it as a personal power tool." Vlasov grimaced briefly. It was clear that it had been a thought that had crossed his mind. "His true intentions may be ambiguous. That may be true, but it never leaves this room. Even if he was not to restore democracy, I believe in his ability to restore hope. And right now? That's what we need most. We need to give the Russian people hope." There was a pause. Vlasov was far from a talented orator, but all were aware of the poor opinion of their organization with most of the subjects they ruled - Zykov had always been a propagandist. "Dismissed." Vlasov barked."

A few chairs had been scattered around, but most had to stand. Vlasov himself was behind his oaken desk, the entire barren room brightly framed by the large window immediately behind him. The old chairman took a cursory glance outside before turning towards Sidorov and the rest of the crowd. "It's no secret that there's been some consternation about the matter of our movement's leadership after I am gone." It was a plain statement, and one that was definitely true. Aides like Sidorov would spend whole meals discussing the matter as if they were adolescents discussing romantic interests. "I have taken a significant amount of time to think about the matter, and I have decided that I will be nominating Sergey Bunyachenko as the next in line for Chairman of our committee." Most of the aides nodded. After all, Bunyachenko was a sensible choice. He was popular with most of the officers and generally avoided shady dealings that some of his peers gleefully engaged in. One of the aides, however, a "friend" of Mikhail Oktan's, piped up. "But why Bunyachenko? I don't get it". A pensive look flashed over Vlasov's face for a minute, before he responded. "Good question", he started, looking directly into the aide's eyes, knowingly. "The ROA is filled with rot - corruption, bribery, nepotism, anything that you can name. I'm no fool, I know it exists. Bunyachenko is a strong, honest man and an honorable general. I know that he will be both a good compromise candidate between our ideologically passionate peers and those who are less so. And I also know that he will work to expose and purge the rot from our organization, forcefully if need be. For if we are to rule all Russia, we need a man and an organization that is free from corruption and interested enough in crushing our enemies to not put his own interests above our ultimate goals. And ultimately..." Vlasov's voice broke before he continued. "I believe he is the only person who can succeed where I have been unable to." The question was not followed up with another - Vlasov solemnly dismissed the aides and instructed them to inform those necessary."

Whatever the meeting was about, thought Andrey Sidorov, one of his key aides, it was serious. Sidorov had been with Vlasov for half a decade, and had witnessed the slide of the once-proud general into what Sidorov believed to be depression, but even he was not prepared for the announcement that Vlasov was prepared to make. After the dozen or so KONR and ROA officers and various aides had taken their seats in chairs that had been hastily brought in by those not privy to the meeting, Vlasov had stood up, and addressed his "crowd". "We are all aware," he began, "that there is the matter of succession within our movement. It has been a matter of contention for some time that when it is time for me to hand off the torch, who would be the one to receive it." There was a pause - a reluctant, grimacing pause, before he continued. "And as such, I have decided that General Mikhail Oktan will be the one to bear the burden of succession". Almost immediately after the name was mentioned, the room began to erupt into discord. Sidorov himself was baffled; Oktan? Even among his allies, Oktan had a reputation for corruption and administrative negligence. He was a decent officer, a sight better than the "cadets" who "volunteered", but nothing special, and he was no friend of Vlasov. Vlasov's voice suddenly boomed throughout the room, a single command - "Silence!" It was obeyed. "Oktan already owns half of the Russian Liberation Army. He attracts those damned opportunists and lackeys, bribing those who can be bought and sidelining those who can't." Vlasov continued to calmly explain his decision. "But if it is anyone but Oktan succeeds me, I worry for the continued existence of our movement. Even if I were to choose someone else, we cannot afford a civil war, and surely Oktan would act against anyone who seeks to exert more control over him than I currently have. This is for the best of the Committee, and the best for the Russian Liberation Army. My decision is final. Prepare to relay it to those who need to know.

Semyon turned to face the source of the voice, and an eyebrow rose in annoyed surprise at the familiar face running towards him. "Ah, General Bunyachenko ordered that no soldier patrol alone for the time being. One of our own got badly beaten by dissidents. I volunteered to join you, seeing as we're old friends." Fyodor explained, having no way of knowing their friendship was not mutual. As they began to walk together despite Semyon's reluctance, Fyodor's latest topic of conversation caught Semyon's interest for once. "...By the way, Semyon, I've been thinking about this for a while, but don't you think it's weird? Bunyachenko's a Ukrainian, yet he's prominent over here instead."\n\nFrowning, Semyon scratched his chin in confusion. "What's so odd about a Ukrainian in Russia?"\n\n"It's not just him." Fyodor quickly assured him. "Old man Kromiadi's a Greek, from down in the Caucasus, and Bayerski is a genuine Pole." Fyodor's voice began to grow hushed. "Nobody really knows anything about Oktan, either, and there are all kinds of rumors swirling about. The most common seem to be that he's a Croat, or a Serb, something like that, and the son of a Balkan baron. And then there's Zykov, who admits he's a Ukranian, and nothing else. I've heard a few rumors that he's a Jew, but-" before he could get anything else out, Fyodor found his mouth covered by Semyon's hand. It'd be a lie to say that he liked the annoying gossip at all, but just hearing something like that could place people in danger.\n\n"Fyodor, perhaps it'd be wisest if we moved on to another topic of conversation."

 SAM.305.t:0 "The Monthly Shipment"
 SAM.305.desc:0 "One of the oddest phenomena in the territory controlled by the ROA was a small train station about an hour's march from the city of Samara. Previously a small stop from West Russia to the city, the station's real name had long been replaced by another. The Contraband Station, as it was now known, was one of the last stops for German smugglers - RK Moskowien garrison members who were paid too little to justify the risks they took. These smugglers, who brought with them just about anything a Russian soldier could dream of, made lucrative deals with the local garrisons to sell them things from tobacco and tea to chocolate and small mementos. Any luxury products that managed to trickle their way down into German-occupied Russia were made available to the ROA soldiers. It was one of the largest benefits to signing on with the ROA - simply put. Their old 'contacts' with the Germans had allowed them to afford a few more luxuries than their ideological rivals.\n\nAs both German and Russian worked to offload the goods from the train, they chatted with one another in broken fragments of their respective tongues, each side having made clear efforts to learn the other's language. One of the Russians asked a German about his family;\n\n"I don't know, honestly", he responded. "They're back in Prussia. I've heard that there's not much in the way of work, but other than that, there's been no word". The German, wanting to be courteous, responded in kind. "What about here? What's life like in Samara?" The Russian chuckled a little bit.\n\n"I wouldn't know. I haven't seen the city in weeks, this is my first time being remotely close to it. Border patrols, skirmishes with bandits. I'm sure you're familiar."\n\nContraband Station was an incredibly strange site for cultural intermingling. The Russian soldiers didn't like their German counterparts who supplied the contraband, and they were confident that the Germans felt the same about them. And yet, the Russians attempted to learn German, and the Germans tried their hand at Russian. Everyone knew each other's names, food was shared, and jokes were made even if the language barrier impeded communication at times. Ultimately, both sides were a part of each other's lives, and both accepted that fact, even if they didn't like those that the fact was made up of."

 SAM.306.t:0 "The Iron Harvest"
 SAM.306.desc:0 ""Harvest Days" was what they were called around these parts. ROA soldiers would descend upon the town in their full battle dress, and proceed to help the local farmers with their harvest, providing the valuable manpower that their fields needed especially since so many of their sons had been conscripted or killed. When the harvest days had first been put in place, there was little trust or goodwill between the soldiers and the villagers, especially considering one of the reasons the soldiers helped out with the harvests was to take some of the food back with them. But as the harvest days became more regular, and the village became more acclimatized to the presence of the ROA they began to see them not as German collaborators, but as protectors. The atmosphere changed, trust was built between civilian and soldier. Eventually, some members of the ROA even began volunteering for the harvest days - usually conscripts who had a background in agriculture - hoping to be assigned to one. With some of the friendliest villages even offering to feed the soldiers during the day, it was a relatively comfortable assignment compared to border patrols or anti-bandit operations.\n\nWhile the Committee for the Liberation of the Russian People was far from popular, they had been working hard to secure their regime, distance themselves from the Germans, and even improve their relations with those that they ruled over. These harvests were a key part of that, and contributed to the image that the ROA was there to help, not hurt; to a large extent, it seemed that it was working. No one liked taxes, especially when they were being extracted in the form of food, and oftentimes after the harvests many of the farmers would stare jealously at the ROA's trucks as they pulled away from their village, wishing they had been able to keep more of the food they had grown. However, on the whole, it was a positive experience. The soldiers had even been effective in getting a few of the local boys and restless farmhands to sign up with the ROA, which further helped dissipate tensions with the locals. Most of the core of the ROA had no local ties to the area around Samara, and having patrols protect those that they knew was a huge boon for the KONR's propaganda machine."

A particularly violent group of bandits that both groups of soldiers had fought with(the bastards). The recent weather (mostly bad). The news from beyond the Urals (very confused). Eventually the topic moved to the WRRF. A few of the veterans of both groups had fought in the fifties. After comisserating on the shame of fighting fellow Russians to defeat the reds, the soldiers shared war stories back and forth. A few more rounds were shared. This casual conversation marked the high point of the evening's mood. Eventually a bitter dispute erupted as to the legitimacy of the ROA. Had it not begun as a German militia, dogs for the invaders? The ROA veteran snapped back that the tsar had been invited by the Germans, and that the white soldiers should not talk about serving tyrants, foreign or domestic.\n\nThe barman did not speak.

He radioed his troops who were observing the situation over at the factories - ROA troops frequently mediated between employers and employees, especially during tense situations like this one. He asked a simple question - "Have they dispersed?" The answer Popov got was not the one that he was hoping for. "The strikers won't give up", the voice on the other end of the radio responded. "Worse still, there's some rumors among the workers still here and their managers that the strike was actually orchestrated by communist agents, 'plants', as they call them. Things are getting pretty tense, people are throwing things". What came after that was what really worried Major Popov. "Some of the greener troops... I think they're unnerved. If things go south, they might start shooting."\n\nPopov cursed to himself. The damned strikers. It was the third time in three months that this had happened, and each time, it was up to the ROA to sort things out. How many times would he have to deal with this before he made his superiors understand that he, and those he commanded, were soldiers, not policemen? Regardless, Popov had to make a choice - he could send in his troops to disperse the strikers, and potentially kill or weed out the apparent communist plants. Surely, this would calm things down and set a precedent to the ungrateful strikers that their insubordination would not be tolerated. It might make us unpopular in the short run but it would also ensure the stability in our streets, for workers will surely be reluctant to complain if it meant being on the wrong end of the barrel of a gun. However, Popov would have the lives of those workers on his hands. Similarly, if he refused to send in the army, the workers would be happy, and alive of course, but business interests would feel betrayed. It wasn't an easy call by any means, but Popov knew that he would have to make it - it would be a PR disaster if his recruits lost their cool and fired into the crowds."

As a result, it didn't take long for news of an envoy from the east to arrive at a local garrison station. The ROA was consistently weary about outsiders and strangers, to the point where a diplomat from beyond the Urals instantly kicked up suspicion. Maksim Oliynyk, the offer in charge of the garrison station that the envoy had been escorted to, didn't particularly want to meet the man - in fact, he was suspicious that the man was who he claimed he was.\n\nSitting down with the envoy, it was clear that he was frustrated.

"Repurposed" by the ROA itself during the darkest days of the terror bombing, the small shack was soon built up. The "factory" - in reality little more than a large building with a few long, wooden tables and a number of machine tools - was dedicated to taking apart German small arms and reverse engineering them for our own purposes. Vlasov and most of those under him knew well that their German support would eventually run out, and they had long made provisions to ensure that their myriad of German equipment, from Kar98Ks to StG-44s would remain operable even once it was no longer possible to receive their parts from their former benefactors neither officially nor through smugglers. The factory rarely worked during the day - the bombings made it hard to - but workers toiled all night, with small headlamps and minimal light, disassembling old or well-worn rifles and their respective ammunitions. These workers, despite their rugged condition, were not civilians. Not officially, at least. They were engineers, not just employees of the ROA, but members of it and experienced in handling German weapons for many years. Until recently, the factory had been minimally staffed. However, with the increasing amount of bloody victories won by the ROA, the soldiers at the frontline needed more and more weapons, and the number of those that we can get from German smugglers is becoming miniscule compared to our needs. As such, Armaments Factory no.14 has, as of recently, expanded not only in terms of manpower, but location as well. A number of shoddily-constructed buildings have been added to the original to form a sort of complex, where dedicated stations and senior engineers act as efficiency-generating machines. As of late the factory was no longer just reverse-engineering weapons, but producing their own versions of them. Certainly not with the workmanship of the originals, they were cheap and easy to produce, and that's what the high command wanted."

The night was the only time that Vlasov could be alone. Every waking hour of the day he had aides, officers, and administrators asking him the most mundane of questions, but lately he had become disinterested in answering them, instead preoccupying himself with a reflection on his life's work. What was it, if not the Committee? And what had they accomplished? At what cost? These were the questions that resounded in Vlasov's head day and night. "And for the life of me, I can't figure out the answers." he mumbled to himself. He couldn't even remember if his alliance with the Nazis was one of pragmatic survival or the desire to see a Russia forged in his image. He barely had an image anymore. He continued to pace around his room, occasionally glancing up to the stoic portrait of himself that his aides insisted he keep in his office. A single word came to his mind: legacy. What was to be his legacy? Vlasov had always thought about writing a book. After all, who else would tell his story the way that it should be told? "The Germans remember me as a traitor, the Russians remember me as worse. Those in the West barely even know who I am." He stated to no one in particular. Realistically, no book would be coming. Vlasov knew he couldn't. After pacing some more, he sat, slumped in his desk chair, looking at his drink. It had become harder to resist the urges to refill the glass over and over with the premium vodka he had "liberated" for himself. He looked to his glass - it was now empty. When did he drink it? He couldn't remember. Glancing towards his desk, there were two items that came to his attention - the bottle and his service pistol.

Years of promotion, attrition and desertion have unbalanced our officer pool, especially at the junior level. Our army is now dangerously top heavy, and needs new blood to fill out its command structure.\n\nFortunately, local recruits form a satisfactory pool of potential officers. The only issue is that the years of sitting around have begun polarizing the soldiers into three different groups. Some of the more idealistic recruits follow Zykov's faction, and argue that the ROA should live up to its promises of liberation and democracy. In contrast, a group of black market smugglers and hardline fascists have coalesced around general Oktan's promises of a strong Russia where the soldiers are fully respected. In between these two hands, the officer committee tries to maintain the status quo by recruiting dutiful and apolitical men who share General Bunyachenko's apathy and desire to see the junta's structure endure until the situation has changed.\n\nThe composition of officers we choose will help determine the direction the ROA takes.

"It spreads like a cancer, Arkady..." he said, frustrated with his inability to stop the cretin. "He buys who he buys, and it seems like nowadays everyone has their price." The usually-loquacious Popov seemed dismal, while Antonov, ever the deadpan figure, remained steel-faced. "Well?" asked Bunyachenko. "What do we do now?"\n\nPopov nervously checked his watch, and was about to answer when a sharp rap at the door interrupted him. Before Bunyachenko could even ask who was interrupting him, four of his personal guards entered, their weapons drawn. Rising from his desk, Bunyachenko asked, "What is going on?" a tone of suspicion was confirmed as he looked to Popov and Antonov, who had since stood up and drawn their sidearms.\n\n"Sergey Bunyachenko," Antonov started, "The Officers Committee has placed you under arrest following an investigation into corruption and nepotism charges.

Remember, struggle not against your family, but against those who threaten it!"\n\nToday, Zykov took to the air to announce the end of the mutinies and to encourage those still in arms to give up, offering amnesty to all those who were not involved in instigating the mutiny. The path to end the mutiny and prevent an all-out explosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to exhibit perfectly the tenets that Macchiavelli wrote about centuries ago. Zykov had bribed those who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those who would do neither. The combination worked, if just barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and the immense amount of relief given by them, was swirling around the heads of the committee, which Zykov stood in front of. The enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing to the committee about the situation, and the fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. "As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized this mutiny against the authority of our dear chairman." Actually, for most, that was a surprise. "Indeed, it's clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate such a rat-like insubordinate in our ranks, no matter how entrenched he may be." Zykov looked around this room, his cool, calculating gaze analyzing each committee member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. "Very well. If it is the will of the committee, I will order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial."\n\nOktan would not get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, ultimately being shot. His body was burned.

You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces."\n"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the officer committee?

Overwhelmed by the stern defence of these brave soldiers and surrounded on all sides by a jeering populace, the putschists soon felt the jaws of the state closing in around their pathetic rebellion, and fled to the outlying districts, where they soon turned to brigandry to survive. Commander Bunyachenko has called for peace and reconciliation, claiming that the putschists had nothing to do with him or the officer's committee. While the disloyal general is likely to be kept on the general staff, his political career is widely seen as irreparably damaged.

Switzerland had many, many talented banking representatives who worked for him, but none outshined Luca. A tall and gaunt man with a talent for numbers who allegedly never smiled, and most importantly never spoke a single word of their conversations to anyone.\n\nWithin the darkness of night, Luca entered softly and silently before sitting, a small folder of forms in his hand. Largely just a reassessment of "inventory", "funds", and potentially lucrative assets, the reading of the forms went on for hours before Mikhail raised a hand.\n\n"How much of it can be transferred?"\n\n"To?" Luca asked, as Mikhail sighed.\n\n"Switzerland. How much of my assets can be transferred to Switzerland? I think...it may be prudent to safely store some of my riches. In fact; how is my vacation home?" A pause, as Luca looked at him.\n\n"I have no intention of leaving." Oktan stated quickly. "Russia - requires a strong man to keep it going. It's impossible to leave it like it is. Still... how is my vacation home?" He asked, as Luca rolled his eyes."

That faction was now scattered, its members fled or missing. But not him.\n\nBecause, Samutin knew, as much as Oktan or his henchmen might have wanted to add his name to a list, they still, if they wanted territory to continue to loot, had to run a country. That took professionals. Administrators. Men who would tell the truth when decisions arose, even if that truth was unpalatable. Men like him.\n\nThat did not, as Samutin had been made painfully aware of, mean that he was safe. Far from it. He was expected to work. Expected to perform. Expected to obey. Expected to be on his best behaviour. He very much intended to be - he had been given a second chance, and he knew that a third would not be given, no matter how dire the nation's need might be. If his first task was anything to go by, that need would, in fact, soon be so dire.\n\nHe was to complete an inventory and report on the state of hundreds of industrial sites in Western Russia. Sites that the ROA had 'secured' during its regional campaigns. Sites that Oktan and his men had likely looted of everything of value. Sites that would have to be rebuilt, at the people's expense, if Russia was to continue standing.\n\nWith a sigh, he began arranging for transport. His personal feelings no longer mattered. What mattered was that he was alive, and he intended to remain so. It was time to work."

Samarin knew that the man would not have been able to advance as far as he had without possessing considerable, if warped, political intelligence. He also knew that Oktan's slavish dedication to personal profit offered opportunity to those under him that, like Samarin, were true ideologues.\n\nAnd so he, a lifelong believer in the strength and national advancement promised by fascist ideals, had agreed to join Russia's governing kleptocrat, receiving an appointment as Foreign Minister. He imagined that Oktan saw the whole situation as something of a twisted joke, using one such as he to promote the 'virtues' of his gangster state. Samarin knew that, regardless of what he was told, he was being watched, and so he would act his part, and do his job.\n\nStill, even though Samarin knew his position as one of expediency, it did not mean that he did not burn with anger and hatred every time he watched Oktan or one of his cronies siphon more resources away from Russia and towards themselves. And, so, he had decided to, within the bounds of his position, do something about it.\n\nHe could, and would, use his authority to establish a domestic, grassroots political organization. An organization dedicated to strength and national advancement, virtues that Oktan and his faction could not publicly disavow.\n\nOne day, he hoped, it might be strong enough to restore some semblance of true government to the country that he loved so much."

He looked at his fellow officers with contempt, muttering to himself, "I won. I beat you. The scheming Jew and the old man, dust in the wind. They will remember me, they will build statues of me!" Okhtan shook his head, throwing the photo into the flames of his hearth, the gilded forms of Roman gods watching the Samara Four blacken and curl in the heat. Okhtan uncorked a crystal decanter of fine plundered liquor, pouring himself a tumbler-full. He raised the bitter glass to his lips, savoring the harsh flavor as it burned down his throat. He could be whatever he liked, he mused. President? Tsar? Emperor? Vozhd? Whatever title Okhtan pleased, he could adopt. The thought of "Vozhd-Emperor" crossed his mind, but he dismissed it as ridiculous.\n\nAll, he supposed, was not well. While his immediate threats had been dealt with, there were rumblings beneath his feet. The "orthodox" fascists in Samara hated him, and Kromiadi and Truhin threatened his rule with officer cliques and schemes. No matter, mused Okhtan, today he was king of the Russians. Kings often ruled with a golden scepter in one hand and a butcher's cleaver in the other, why shouldn't Okhtan? Today, he would relax and enjoy the fruits of his labor. Tomorrow, heads would roll."

"This newspaper has been deemed illegal by the government and the ROA. All who refuse to leave these premises will be removed by force and placed in jail for conspiracy to promote a communist revolution and assassinate Chairman Zykov. Those arrested will not be released until the elections conclude. However, I promise if you leave willingly you may go about your lives without the threat of arrest nor harm."\n\n"Please, just listen to these men." Said Mark, the head writer of the newspaper. "Things have gotten better now. We're having elections, we don't need to destabilize them with left-wing newspapers, writing about how much better a socialist state could be."\n\n"What has gotten into you Mark," shouted Yelena as she began to cry. "These men obviously don't support democracy! Does a democracy have secret police that arrests anyone with a radical opinion? You were bought out by these guys, weren't you, Mark! That's how they found us!"\n\nMark stammered, saying, "Well... uh... still, I had to Yelena, they would have arrested all of us! Please, just go, forget about all of this."\n\n"I will never forget this, and I'll never support some fake democracy that arrests those who oppose it!

From what he heard in Sverdlovsk back in the day, they were traitorous bastards from Western Russia.\n\nOn the other hand, the administration was still very nice towards him, except for placing him in Omsk of course. Still, he was given many resources to maintain stability in the territories under his control, and any threat of Black League remnants was swiftly taken care of by the army.\n\nYet did the ROA really work towards the good of Russia, or were the rumors of them being collaborators true? Was it bad to help the ROA achieve their goals and help them maintain control of their new territories? Was he giving up everything he fought for in the Ural Military District, for the good of Russia?"

The social democrat, liberal, and conservative opposition all won a few seats in the election. This means they will have a struggle against the Zykovite majority, but any opposition is an opposition.\n\nWhile some have said this means Russia is hardly a democracy as the opposition party has little power, it still shows we have come a long way from a dictatorship. People may even take an interest in the opposition and democracy as they continue to exist. Everything is only starting to take shape.\n\nHowever, the opposition party being allowed into power is not making things easy for us, even with our large majority. Many still criticize the ROA's past deeds, so Zykov's government may not be able to work as well with the opposition as he had hoped.

Zykov had only now just picked it up, several minutes before his meeting with the man. Better to get the measure of the man in the flesh rather than in paper.\n\nA knock came at Zykov's office door, and the wily propagandist bid the visitor enter. In came Ivan Silayev, his lined face further creased by a grin, his graying hair swept back.\n\n"President Zykov, a pleasure to finally meet you," said the man, extending his hand to Zykov, who accepted it in his own. Zykov smiled back, bidding his visitor to take a seat.\n\n"I understand you have a proposition for me?" asked the president of the Russian Republic. Silayev launched into his speech, big talk regarding the integration of industry and big business into the government itself, a corporate oligarchy with the backing of the state. Zykov listened intently. It was an interesting proposal.\n\n"Very well, Silayev, welcome to the Unity Party." Silayev's eyes glittered like tiny gems in the lamplight at Zykov's words. "Trial by fire," said Zykov next, and a startled Silayev blinked. Zykov grinned, "Prove your worth to the party.

Such thoughts were ridiculous, really, all he had to do was pass the post and submit his ballot. This was how things were done in a democracy, but to vote for himself seemed the height of arrogance.\n\n"Mr. Arkhipov," repeated the kindly old man standing outside of the booth, "you may enter when you are ready, but do hurry, the line is backing up." The old man, who had likely seen tyrannies unending, seemed delighted to be exercising his democratic rights and gave Arkhipov a reassuring smile. "First time voting?" asked the man, and the marine flashed a nervous smile and swallowed harshly.\n\n"Yes, it is. Sorry, I'll stop holding up the line."

What was that Hitler had said of Russia? Kick in the door and the whole rotting foundation would come crashing down? Ironic, then, that Germany was riddled with rot, resting atop a mountain of corpses created by the civil war. Rotten foundations indeed, thought Bayerski.\n\nHe stopped fiddling with his tie for a moment, his hands falling to his side slowly as he fixed his gaze with that of his reflection. God, did he really look so old? So tired? He remembered the flight from Poland, his capture by the hated Germans, his own terrible shame at serving in their puppet army. He looked into his own eyes and saw horrors laid over horrors, a waking nightmare that would not end. Bayerski blinked, forcing down the screams, rattling machine guns, and the smell of smoke and blood that threatened to overtake him in that moment. No, he was in control. Bayerski nodded to his reflection. He would help take Russia by the hand into the new age, and with the support of Zykov, defend this infant republic to the bitter end. Bayerski forced a grim smile.

 SAM_bunyachenko.1.t:0 "Out on the Field of Gold"
 SAM_bunyachenko.1.desc:0 "The President had had enough of paperwork for the day. His guard, as always, refused him the luxury of wandering the streets of the capital. Far better for his evening walks to be in the presidential palace's gardens. Gardens were a bit too grandiose a word, Bunyachenko thought, for the half finished assembly of shrubs and plants.\n\nWalking loops around the closed garden, the president's thoughts were free to wander beyond the confine of the park. Politics was a new career for him. A soldier's life had been his, after joining the red army as a teenager. Hard fighting in the plains of Ukraine, against the whites and the Ukrainian National Republic. Bunyachenko had been free, then. He and his comrades, fighting for a new Russian nation, freed from archaic tsarism, fighting with the naivety of youth for a better future. After the civil war he had been deployed to central Asia, fighting Basmachi rebels. Different plains, but the same endless blue sky. The president smiled bitterly. Freedom, as always, was wasted on the young.\n\nThe Reds had turned out no better than the Tsar. Endless court politics, as Bukharin's boyars ran roughshod over the country. Ukraine had not been spared their incompetence. Fields of gold, exploited by faceless bureaucrats. Neither had Bunyachenko. Yet he had kept fighting. Accused by the paranoid men in Moscow of failing to win a war their incompetence had caused to be doomed from the start. He had fought on then, naively, too. Being captured by the Germans had merely confirmed the Red's paranoid accusations that he was a traitor.\n\nHe hated the Germans for destroying Russia. Truth be told, however, they had merely ended what the Bukharinists had begun. It felt good to know that the WRRF was dead and buried. Now all the President had to do was to destroy the Germans, kick over their own rotting structure. Perhaps then he would truly be free, innocent in the court of public opinion. Until then he had to keep following orders. Stuck in the presidential palace, Sergey Bunyachenko continued his evening walk round and round his prison's courtyard."

A small band played the Japanese national anthem as Bunyachenko confidently shook the hands of the Japanese delegates before escorting them to a line of gleaming automobiles, surrounded by an honor guard.\n\nPerhaps they expected a ramshackle hovel, the cramped presidential palace of yet another Russian warlord with delusions of grandeur. And, had they wandered beyond the main streets, they might have been correct. But Bunyachenko left nothing to chance: the Japanese sun flag hung from freshly-installed lampposts, while the Japanese emissaries silently watched the meticulously cleaned and spotless cityscape roll past.\n\nThe Japanese were a people of order, of punctuality, of proper appearances. And they were arrogant - an opportunity Bunyachenko would not squander.\n\nMuch later, as Bunyachenko bade the Japanese good night after a sumptuous, extravagant banquet, the Mitsubishi representative laughed drunkenly to his colleagues, forgetting the presence of Bunyachenko's translator: "If only half the Sphere were as agreeable as these Russians!"
