 THENEWORDER_NAME:0 "The New Order"
 THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Установился Новый Порядок. После победы держав Оси во Второй мировой войне мир бесповоротно изменился. Великие империи превратились в пыль. Немец первым высаживается на Луну, пока в Рейхе ждут скорой смерти Гитлера. В Америке рушится старая система, баланс сил на Средиземноморье нарушен. Китай, лишь раб Японии, начинает изменяться. А в России поверженные варлорды мечтают о мести."

 USA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Когда Америка вступила во Вторую мировую войну, последние дни прежней Европы уже были сочтены. Конечно, Соединенные Штаты действовали превосходно, подавив Кригсмарине в Атлантике и начав переламывать ситуацию на Тихом океане, но изобретение атомной бомбы положило конец любым надеждам оставшихся у Союзников на победу американцев.\n\nТеперь, двадцать лет спустя, Америка раздроблена. В то время как очередной экономический кризис спадает, американская политическая сцена по-прежнему пребывает в хаосе. Правительство зажато между беспокойными республиканцами-демократами и Национальной Прогрессивной партией, неудавшимся союзом политических изгоев Америки. С учетом движения за гражданские права, значительно изменившим политическую сферу, 60-е годы будут предвещать самые большие угрозы, с которыми когда-либо сталкивалась Америка."
 CAN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In the wake of the fall of Britain the Canadians turned their heads to their southern neighbors for leadership and guidance, even as the Royal Family settled in Ottawa. Rising from the shadows of George Drew's conservative political machine, Lester Pearson and his Liberal Party have risen through snap elections to stand at the helm of a nation struggling to define itself. Constitutional monarchy or a free republic? British, French, Quebecois, or all of the above, or none? Is the nation forever doomed to be an appendage of US foreign policy? What can be done about the increasingly virulent separatism afflicting Quebec? In the uncertainty, one thing is certain: Canada must stand together, both within and without, or the land that stretches from sea to sea will quickly find itself becalmed by currents it cannot withstand."
 CUB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Socialism and freedom from foreign domination. These were the values Fidel Castro fought for against the government of Fulgencio Batista- at least until he received an offer from the CIA. In exchange for covert support in overthrowing the worryingly pro-German Batista, Castro would refrain from advocating revolution or anti-Americanism in the Western Hemisphere and allow American corporate investment into Cuba. Although it angered communist hardliners, the deal allowed Castro's socialist revolutionaries to sweep into power. But as hardliners plot to expel the CIA's influence from Cuba, and as opposition builds in the States to this bastion of communism so close to American shores, who knows how long this will last?"
 ICE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "It's become something of a joke, that Iceland is as free a nation as Greenland is green.\n\nWhile ostensibly independent, the presence of the United States military is felt everywhere. Bases dot the island and nearly as many of its inhabitants live in a military base as outside of them. While at first the arrival of American troops was seen as a positive mark, a sure sign of the nation's continued freedom against German rule in Europe, this has quickly turned against the Americans. Now seeing as occupiers and with unrest growing, the US holds onto the island ever harder, fearing a soft German coup in the northern Atlantic."
 AST_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Australia- a continent, an island, and a country, located on the edge of the world. Sitting just below Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere, it either narrowly avoided or repelled invasion in the Second World War, depending on who you ask. In the years after, Australian society, encouraged by their American allies, became more and more militarized to ward off the looming Japanese threat, even as the Sphere pulled back towards defending what it had already gained. Postwar Australian politics came to be dominated by two political blocs- the conservative coalition between the United Australia Party and Australian Country Party, and the Australian Labour Party. The two would spar on issues from Australia's military involvement to the controversial White Australia Policy, and as further conflicts flare up around the globe, who will come out on top?"
 NZL_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "New Zealand is a small island nation on the periphery of the world, often forgotten among the superpower politics of Washington and Tokyo. However, for New Zealanders, superpower politics could not be closer to home. Thousands of New Zealanders fought the Japanese in the Second World War, many of them perishing in the process. After the war ended, its scars remained, with New Zealand facing demographic damage, lost trade partners, economic crisis, and an increasingly pushy America using the nation's islands as bases for its military transport to Australia. Although the conservative National Party has managed to steer the ship of state thus far, for how long will they be able to maintain their strength?"
 SAF_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "A monarchy without a monarch and a nation without direction, the Union of South Africa has found itself increasingly struggling to hold back the forces of unrest waiting to tear the nation asunder.\n\nWhile the Boers have never managed to take power in the nation, their presence is felt as more and more they clamor for either representation or outright independence. Elsewhere, the Africans shout from the streets against a nation of segregation, if not in law than in practice. If its domestic issues were not enough, South Africa finds itself torn between two spheres, constantly being pressured by the Americans to join the OFN and the Germans to bow to the Reich."
 GUY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As German panzers rolled along Downing Street, British Guiana suddenly found itself free of Imperial influence, and from the ashes of the war, the Republic of Guyana was born. Not all is fine in the Republic, however. Hers is a story told far too often throughout history; a feeble nation used and shackled down to suffer. Their own beloved President, Cheddi Jagan, was voted out and exiled by a CIA-rigged election in the 50's.\n\nGuyana's new president inspires not hope, but fear. Forbes Burnham an iron-fisted strongman, and under his leadership, the liberties of Guyanans grow weaker with each passing day. Strict racial segregation laws have been introduced, restricting the rights of Indo-Guyanans. Will Burnham continue to strike down his opponents? Or will Guyana break her chains and be freed?"

 BRT_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Brittany owes much to the hun.\n\nWhile the nation claims to be a proud member of the Unity-Pakt, in reality Brittany is the greatest thorn in the alliance's side. The largest black market in Europe, some have called Brittany the 'syndicate with a state'. Seeing the amassing of wealth and the weakening of the Pakt as its best chance to ensure domestic stability and keep itself protected, Brittany's only interest in the Pakt is how long it can use it to stave off the looming threat of Burgundy. There are those, however, scorned old friends of President Mordrel, who believe new direction is necessary on the peninsula."
 MAD_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Madagaskar is falling down.\n\nThe garrison seems to be increasingly paranoid and ever crueler in its attempts to prove itself as true children of Germany despite their blood and pasts. The Jewish, a leftover from a time when Germany hoped it could simply remove its untermensch by shipping them overseas, have increasingly begun calling the nation their 'Israel' and the insurgency has proven both bloody and nearly impossible for the garrison to contain. When these two groups are not causing trouble, the rising tides of African nationalism has also brought the natives up in arms. While this all threatens to tear the nation apart, Reichskommissar Maurice sits in his office, quietly committing treason."
 GGN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 ""Germanization is at an all time high! Dissent is at an all time low! Poland is pacified, hell, it mind as well be named Southern Prussia!"\n\nThis sentence was the first in one of the many reports Hans Frank has sent to the Reichstag, as he has done dutifully for over a decade. On paper, his rule is the strongest and most impressively done in the Reich, having followed Nazi policy to a T and done so with the finesse and ability of the greatest of politicians. In reality, Poland is a collapsing mess, and in shadows and sewer tunnels, the resistance waits for the German grip to slip..."
 OST_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Жемчужина нацистской короны, Остланд считается образцовой колонией для всех немецких администраций.\n\nГерманизация в Остланде проходит по самым высоким темпам в Рейхе, ее промышленное и сельское производство достигло небывалых высот, а Рейхскомиссар Лозе собирается сделать первые шаги к подписанию постоянного перемирия с несколькими крупнейшими партизанскими группировками в стране.\n\nКонечно, если Лозе вдруг отойдет от дел, а Родина погрузится в пучину гражданской войны, останется только смотреть, что станет с колонией, которая так подражала своей метрополии..."
 MCW_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Kasche sits on a throne of failure. Oddly enough, this has given him great success, just not in the eyes of the Reich.\n\nOnce a staunch proponent of hardline Nazism, his near death at the hands of partisans during the West Russian War has left him as a shell. Now he merely presides over Moskowien with the lightest of hands, hoping to merely prevent more bloodshed from consuming the colony and possibly reaching himself. Every report he sends to Germany, brutally honest with how little progress Germanization has had, is another step towards the firing line. But as the Reich seems to be crumbling, Kasche has already prepared for the inevitabilities. Still, one must wonder what will happen without the colony's apathetic leadership..."
 ENG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Although American aid came to the English in the World War, it was too late, and for the first time, England was invaded by a foreign power. Her empire stripped away, and with an occupation force ensuring 'good order and civility' of the English people, England now faces its darkest hour, with no Arthur to save it. If anything can be said of the British however, it is that they are hard headed, and even now, twenty years later, whispers of rebellion spread.\n\nThe nation now sits on a tipping point, collaborate with the wicked Hun, or risk everything to stop them?"
 BRG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "После окончании Второй мировой войны большая часть северной Франции оставалась под прямым контролем Рейха. Жизнь здесь сначала была жестокой и гнетущей, но со временем ситуация стала налаживаться. Счастье длилось недолго. После неудачного переворота во время войны с западом России Генрих Гиммлер получил от Гитлера северную Францию ​​и Бельгию в качестве своей вотчины. Таким образом Фюрер хотел задобрить своего бывшего последователя и отгородить его от вмешательства во внешнюю политику Германии. Но то, что должно было быть синекурой, стало плацдармом. Территории зарождающегося СС-Орденштадт Бургундия - глина в руках Гиммлера, которую он может лепить по своему усмотрению. И поскольку его планы с каждым днем становятся всё более дерзкими и разрушительными, \"Теневое государство\" может начать плести паутину интриг, угрожающих судьбе Рейха, Европы и, в конечном итоге, всего мира."
 GER_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Германия, в прошлом униженная неудачами Вельткрига, в 1930-х годах под руководством Адольфа Гитлера вновь заняла значимое место на мировой арене. Благодаря неудачам Союзников Вторая мировая завершилась полной победой Рейха.\n\nНа момент 1962 года Германия правит самой могущественной империей на Земле, но, несмотря на её победу, контроль над завоёванными территориями остаётся в лучшем случае шатким. Нация разбита финансовым крахом, отбросившим эконмику на десять лет, а в многочисленной касте рабов, служащей немецкому народ, начали вспыхивать протесты. Сейчас страну захлестнула серия студенческих протестов, помимо этого государственный бюджет начал пустеть из-за махинаций Рейхсбанка."
 CZE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Bohemia should have been part of the Reich by now, but not all things are meant to be.\n\nWhile the protectorate was well on its way towards integration in the 50s, the rapid deterioration of the Reich's power soon put all of these plans on hold.\n\nDespite this, Bohemia ran as normal, before oddly enough the resistance seemed to reappear. Once small cells apparently doubled and tripled in size almost overnight, and the garrison now struggles to hold the line. One can only wonder who would possibly raise so much trouble behind the shadows."
 CRN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The brave sons of Germany watch eternal. Their charge? All of England for the security of the Fatherland. Only the finest soldiers can find posting in the Cornwall Governorate, the center of operations for the entirety of the garrison of occupied England. Having been proven right in Halder's insistence that the English would never peacefully aid in Germany's unification of Europe after their unsuccessful rebellion in the 50s, the garrison now stands on the alert at all times, prepared to do battle for the prosperity of the Pakt.\n\nWords muttered under quiet breaths speak of Germany facing its twilight, and if such a time would come, the Garrison must be ready to do whatever it must do for the homeland. The isles will be secure!"
 ANG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The pilots of Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika rule the skies even while Africa remains locked in chaos. From the airstrips of Angola, hundreds of German bombers filter in and out en-route to bomb West Africa into the dust. From his squadron headquarters, Reichskommissar Schenck rules, treating the natives with a light hand and his duties even more lightly, many have criticized his hands off attitude and seeming unwillingness to actually rule the nation.\n\nTo Schenck, however, only the skies can provide him solace from the hell that he had a hand in creating, and some whisper that the Reichskommissar is not entirely loyal to the Reich, but from all reports, Schenck remains as loyal as he has ever been, a model hero of German aviation."
 MZB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Some say that each Reichskommissariat is but a mirror of its ruler. Indeed, Ostafrika is very similar to Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig: both are dry, pitiless and utterly devoid of humanity.\nUnder the watchful eye of their Aryan masters, the inferiors toil, their blood, their tears and their deaths nothing but the perfect fuel for the Reich. Even the watchers, however, are under scrutiny: Hüttig despises incompetence and pity, and will crush anyone displaying said defects. What awaits his enemies is a lifetime of suffering, where even death is a luxury.\nIn a world of degenerates and traitors, Hans Hüttig will uphold the Aryan standard, no matter the odds, no matter the means, no matter the price."
 COG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Covered by a lush jungle and filled with wildlife that would make all hunters weep in joy, the former Belgian Congo is the richest of all the German colonies. Under the perfect façade, however, lies a dangerous world, far more dangerous than any safari may be.\nReichskommissar Siegfried Müller spends his days hunting, neglecting the administration, and the entire colony has been turned into a private business for the many corporations, both German and foreign, lusting after Zentralafrika's resources.\nHowever, despite being a seasoned hunter, Müller might find himself prey to far larger predators: there are dangers lurking in the jungles, and sometimes, ink and paper can cause more slaughter and suffering than any set of fangs."
 CAU_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Reichskommissariat Kaukasien was originally meant to be a \"model colony\" of sorts, one where the natives would live peacefully under the Reich's watchful eye. The natives, of course, had different ideas. When the West Russian War broke out, the \"Transcaucasian Soviet\" launched a mass rebellion, besieging the capital of Tiflis and almost linking up with the Red Army. They were defeated, but it was clear that a firmer hand was needed. Enter Josias, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. He was renowned for his methodical efficiency, but after being captured and tortured by Transcaucasian partisans, he also became known for his methodical extermination of rebels. The Reich doesn't bother him as long as the oil flows, but they fail to notice that his loyalties may lie elsewhere..."
 IRE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Ireland's entry into the Second World War ensured its territorial unification, but it came at a cost.\n\nThroughout the 1950's, Ireland attached itself ever closer to the seemingly prosperous German Reich, adopting its military as a model, and its companies as sources of revenue. This close attachment has meant that Ireland went down with the sinking ship that was the German economy. While extremism on both sides of the isle rose since the crash, Éamon de Valera's successor, Seán Lemass, took the necessary steps to protect Irish democracy and independence, at the great expense of individual freedoms.\n\nMeanwhile, Ireland's northern counties, ruled by Neil Blaney, appear more unstable by the day, and its mismanagement could well prove the final nail in democracy's coffin."

 JAP_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The sun never sets on the Japanese Empire, or at least it hasn't yet. Reigning over the single largest population of any nation on Earth, the Japanese maintain the largest military, industrial base, and navy in the world. With treaty ports in America and ownership of the Pacific, Japan has gone from a shut in nation behind the Europeans to the masters of the sea and land. All is not well, however, as the increasingly byzantine Imperial Court constantly undermines the monarchy, and the more Japan uses China's resources, the more their grip on the colonies slip."
 
## NEUTRAL ##
 IBR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "With Germany victorious in the Second World War, many expected Spain to rise alongside it. When Spain refused to bend to the will of Germany however tensions soon began to rise. The Germans finally demanded they bend to their demands to build the Dam of Gibraltar, which the Spanish finally relented to.\n\nThis led to chaos however as the Atlantropa plan failed, and as Germany confiscated Portugal's Africa colonies and began sabre rattling against their southern neighbors, Portugal and Spain agreed to unification to better hold off German invasion. This invasion never came however, and now the two rest uneasily with one another. As German might fades into the past, so too does this uncomfortable union..."

 BAS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Trofim Lysenko leads his clique of scientist from atop the Black Mountain, reigning over his people as a dictator. Helped by the NKVD, Lysenko abducts unknowing Russians for testing, attempting to create a super soldier able to finally drive the Germans out of Russia. His pseudoscientific beliefs and army of scientists make him one of the most feared rulers in the Urals, second only to the Black Bandit himself. Magnitogorsk has come to be content with his iron rule, and if Lysenko can keep the NKVD in check, he will reign for years to come..."

 ORE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Orenburg and the surrounding areas were spared the chaos brought on by the end of the USSR. Lacking any major industrial centers or natural resources, local villages soon returned to a way of life centered around land, family, church and village. In time Orenburg emerged as a neutral ground where peasants and workers of the region could trade and live in peace. The city, mostly ignored by German bombers, was left free to prosper; peasants began exchanging their crops for tools and supplies, creating a blossoming economy. Soon rumors spread of an oasis of peace, south of the Urals. However, not all is well for the young Workers' State. As threats loom on the horizon, Orenburg will have to react to the onslaught brought on by the foes on the border. How much freedom will Orenburg be forced to give up, in order to survive?"

 ORS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger and his Black Brigade wreak havoc across the Southern Urals, looting and plundering anything that gleams golden. Dirlewanger and his men rape the ones they fancy and shoot the rest. The Black Brigade has become a daunting shadow across the Southern Urals, ruling with an iron fist forged out of the blades of those who crossed them. They attack unsuspecting villages in the dead of night, massacring the populace and taking all the valuables they can get there greedy little hands on. Dead at Dirlewanger's feet lay children, women, and men. All who crossed him. All who doubted him. All who second-guessed him. No men dare to say a word, as they know they may be the next to be lifeless under Dirlewanger's feet."

 URL_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Vorkuta has always been cold and unforgiving, which made it the perfect place to put enemies of the Soviet Union. After the chaos of the German Invasion, however, the gulags which housed those prisoners were abandoned. Due to the influence of Father Janis Mendriks, the guards and their captives put aside their differences and united for survival. They traveled a Long March south before establishing themselves in a network of mountain fortresses. This coalition of military outposts came to be known as the Ural League, and with the Southern Urals being one of the most dangerous places in Russia, the League have become the protectors of the region by default. Now, they face the greatest foes they have ever dealt with since the German invasion. Will the Guard stand strong, or will it crumble and leave the innocents of the region defenseless?"
 
 #West Russia
 KIR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the West Russian Revolutionary Front surged toward Moskau, the Germans were desperate for assistance to halt their advance. They found that in Vladimir Romanov, rightful heir to the Russian Empire, who had long dreamed of retaking his shattered homeland.\n\nPermitted to assemble a division of Russian exiles and volunteers, Vladimir was able to participate in the counteroffensive against the Revolutionary Front. Unexpectedly for the Germans, however, when the Revolutionary front began to collapse and the Wehrmacht's own offensive stalled, Vladimir's did not, advancing to and seizing control of the lands around Vyatka.\n\nEstablishing a pocket of monarchist rule, Tsar Vladimir III now rules as a reluctant autocrat while preparing to retake and restore the rest of the nation, knowing that it will take a strong hand to reunite Russia but hoping that his subjects will eventually have a voice in their government.\n\nThe Imperial state faces many challenges, including bickering generals, rival political cliques, and even questions of his own role and purpose in the government. Very soon the time will arrive when these questions will have to be answered, and the fate of both the Romanovs, and the Russian Empire, decided for all."
 
 NIK_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed at the end of the West Russian War, it was in Syktyvkar, capital of the Komi ASSR, that the civilian government of the Front found themselves in. From the witches' brew of WRRF officials, Soviet political exiles, refugees, and those who would be unwelcome in other statelets, the Komi Republic took form, establishing a constitution and democratic institutions which served to end the cycles of violence which had afflicted it.\n\nHowever, all is not well in the Republic - political conflict and scheming is reaching a crisis point, and it seems that the days of this democracy are limited."
 
 PRM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Alexey Dobrovolsky was once just like any other Slav, weak and cowardly, blindly following the orders of his superiors in the West Russian Revolutionary Front. It was not until he was sent to die in battle against the Germans that he saw what true strength looked like. He saw mighty Aryan warriors smashing the weak Russians who dared oppose them, demonstrating the superiority of the master race. While the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed around him, Alexey had an epiphany: Aryanism is not physical. It is psychological, and those who are worthy of becoming ubermensch can ascend to join the master race by casting aside their old, inferior cultures. Alexey Dobrovolsky died that day. Gutrum Vagner and the Aryan Brotherhood were born.\n\nMen fleeing from the Red Army flocked to join the brotherhood, drawn by its promises of enlightenment and a new dawn for a stronger Russia. Eventually Vagner's followers grew into the thousands, and the Fyurer declared it was time for the master race to conquer the east once and for all. The Brotherhood stormed into Perm, capturing the city and declaring the birth of a new Reykh. Since then they have expanded to the south and west, enslaving thousands of subhumans and uplifting anyone they find that is worthy of joining the ranks of the ubermensch. The Fyurer is not content with mindless raiding and pillaging, as fun as it is. He has far greater plans for the Brotherhood, plans that will be set in motion soon."
 
 SAM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Born of hazy post-war plans, the Russian Liberation Army, or ROA, was envisioned as nothing more than a collaborator militia writ large. Led by General Vlasov and a collection of turncoat Red Army officers, the ROA was meant to help legitimize German control of RK Moskowien until the Russians could be driven further east or exterminated.\n\nThe West Russian War in the fifties changed all of this. Expanded by the desperate Germans and deployed to delay the resurgent Red Army, the ROA thrived against all odds and soon found itself pushing east. By the war's end, Vlasov and his men controlled a power base beyond the Reich's grasp. Written off as mutinous rabble, the ROA has spent the intervening years waiting. Some hope for redemption; the others merely await the opportunity to carve an empire in Western Russia and beyond."

 #West Siberia
 ISH_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Russia was a land of battling cliques long before the Soviet Union fell to the Germans. In the chaotic days after Lenin's death multiple successors vied for control over the young Union. For a brief moment it appeared as though the crown might pass to Joseph Stalin, but tragedy struck. Stalin met with a mysterious and untimely demise, and his supporters were scattered across the Union, relegated to positions of no importance as Bukharin secured control. One of those men sent to Siberia was Lazar Kaganovich, and he never forgot the teachings of his mentor. When the Union collapsed under the weight of the German invasion Kaganovich was quick to act. Securing the support of Field Marshal Rokossovsky and Lieutenant-General Karbyshev, he took control of a massive stretch of territory from the Urals to Omsk. Kaganovich proclaimed the West Siberian People's Republic and prepared to retake the Union.\n\nIt was not meant to be. Both of his allies soon distanced themselves from Kaganovich, eventually breaking away entirely. Rokossovsky seized Sverdlovsk and the Republic's northern territories, While Karbyshev's Black League took the city of Omsk and its surroundings. Now Kaganovich is left ruling a fraction of his former territory from the city of Tyumen. Most men in his situation would have given up, but Kaganovich is made of stronger stuff. Soon his armies will march north and south, annihilating the traitors and reclaiming the Republic. Kaganovich is determined to reunite the Soviet union and avenge himself and his old mentor, the original man of steel."
 
 OMS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Организованная старым красным генералом Дмитрием Карбышевым, Чёрная Лига Омска изначально была тайным военным обществом в рядах Красной Армии, которое стремилось свергнуть некомпетентное коммунистическое руководство и сподвигнуть русский народ к полному уничтожению ненавистных немцев, чего бы это ни стоило. Карбышев сам прошёл через годы боли и ненависти, за которые ответственны немецко-фашистские захватчики.\n\nПосле неудавшегося переворота против Советской власти в Тюмени и отступления в Омск, Чёрная Лига укоренилась в своём экстремистском видении и стремится только к тому, чтобы жестоко отомстить всем врагам России и гарантировать, что Родине больше никогда не будет угрожать опасность."
 
 TOB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky and his 3rd Army defended the Soviet Union from the fascist invader until there was no longer a union to defend. Bloodied but not defeated, Rokossovsky withdrew eastward, where he found himself part of the West Siberian People's Republic. However, seeing the corruption, incompetence, and callousness of the Republic's leadership, Rokossovsky quickly became disillusioned, and when the opportunity arose, he broke away and declared a rival military government in Sverdlovsk, seizing much of the Republic's northern territories along with it.\n\nNow, Sverdlovsk stands alone against the approaching storm, the bearer of the shining light of liberty in a land of oppression and death. Rokossovsky, as old as he is, remains steadfast in his desire to reunite the Motherland with the military at the helm, serving the worker and peasant above the bureaucrat, aristocrat, or apparatchik."
 
 #Central Siberia
 ERS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Even as the USSR burned around them, a collection of idealist Scholars, Artists, Poets, Scientists, and Authors came together in a noble attempt to rise from the ashes. This experiment quickly spread through Central Siberia, and, over time, came to be what is now known as the Central Siberian Republic. Using an unorthodox rotating constitution, rewritten after each election by the ruling party, the Republic was seen by many as a bastion of democratic thought and a revival of the democratic ideals of 1917.\n\nIn the end, ironically, it was the Bolsheviks once more that brought the Founders' dreams of democracy crashing down. Facing invasion from the east, several of the CSR's constituent cities revolted, and now the former bastion of liberty in Russia is ruled by despotic juntas, rampaging anarchists, and repressive bolsheviks. But not all hope is lost - the CSR's government, located in the city of Tomsk under a provisional government led by Boris Pasternak, has survived, and as the year 1962 dawns, the President prepares to restore full democracy to the Republic.\n\nCome then, Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the Symphony that is the Russian People play."

Николай Крылов был начальником штаба 62-й армии во время Великой Отечественной войны, за свою службу он руководил войсками в крупнейших сражениях на Восточном фронте. Однако, все крупные военные операции Николая заканчивались катастрофой. К моменту развала Союза 62-я армия уже распалась. Крылов и его офицерская клика удирали на восток, в конце концов они оказались в появившейся Среднесибирской республике. Здесь он вновь потерпел позорное поражение от Сибирской черной армии, которая разгромила остатки его армии. Последней каплей стало то, что один из его ближайших соратников предал его и захватил город Красноярск. Не в силах выдержать злоключения, Крылова начал сходить с ума.\n\n В один день генерал предстал перед своими подчиненными в ином обличии. Он объявил, что прозрел. Он стал законным наследником Рюрика, первого царя Руси. Своей главной целью он начал считать полное воссоединение России. Рюрика II короновали, и он быстро привлек внимание людей, которые начали объединяться под его знаменем. Царь обещал людям добычу, многие начали вдохновляться его необычной идеологией. Рюрик II не был похож на старых монархов. Он обещал быть царем Советов, защищая пролетарскую революцию как лидер рабочих и крестьян. В то же время он осудил христианство и династию Романовых как изменников русского народа. Никто, особенно сам царь, не знает, как будет выглядеть воссоединенная Рюриком Россия. Но новый король продолжает готовиться к войне, а это означает, что страна вскоре может сильно преобразиться."
 
 KHA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Siberian Black Army rose in the bleak days of the Siberian War. As the Central Siberian Republic's authority withered and decayed, the Black Army was created by men like Yuri Galanskov and Ivan Stepanov, formed from Soviet defectors, simple peasants and rogue army officers. The newly formed army managed to repeal the Republic and take the area surrounding the city of Kansk. Forming a 'state' based around the principles of militarized anarchism. Inspired by men such as Nestor Makhno, the Siberian Black Army is a society dedicated to freedom and self defense, the army itself asserting little authority beyond what is needed for self defense and membership is a choice, the people are largely free to do as they please. Even still the Black Army's influence grows more with each passing season and many worry it may soon dominate the communes, creating a military dictatorship in all but name."

Under the leadership of the so-called 'Siberian Falcon,' the strongman Alexander Pokryshkin, it forms one of the largest and most powerful splinter states in the region.\n\nOne of the primary beneficiaries of Bukharin's Siberian Plan, Novosibirsk itself possesses both an enormous population and an equally impressive industrial base, matched in capacity only by the prodigious agricultural lands of Altay. These dual advantages situate the state well, providing a solid economic base from which to grow.\n\nNot all is well, however. The young Federation faces threatening neighbors, socialist labor agitation, and many decisions regarding the growing influence of elitist groupings within the government - influence strongly opposed by the unofficial 'second man' within the Federation, Vasily Shukshin, the Mayor of Barnaul.\n\nThough none can say for certain whether the Federation will weather the many challenges ahead, all agree that, should it correctly leverage the significant advantages granted by both position and history, it could serve as the nucleus of a powerful - and ever expanding - nation."
 
 SVO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As units of the Red Army retreated into Tuva and Mongolia under the command of Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky as the Soviet Union collapsed around them, the People's Revolutionary Council was formed jointly by the Red Army remnants and the Mongolian People's Republic out of desperation in order to stave off total collapse.\n\nSince their reluctant exile, however, the PRC has been preoccupied with domestic tensions and lack of organization, staying isolated and uninvolved as a result even during the catastrophic Siberian War, the hope the Russians held of returning home faded more and more as the years passed without any end in sight.\n\nNow, the PRC finds itself at a critical point in its existence: with the Red Army no longer able or willing to remain where they are, the time is fast approaching for them to at last charge forth once more, and take back the homeland from those who have brought it to near ruin."

 #The Far East
 AMR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Когда в России установилась власть Советов, десяткам тысячам гражданам пришлось бежать из страны. Многие из них очутились на востоке, в маньчжурском городе Харбин. Опечаленные своим поражением в Гражданской войне, а также в поисках шанса на искупление и месть, эти изгнанники обратились к новому фашистскому движению, которое только зарождалось в Европе. Множество русских живущих в Харбине приняли фашизм, который стал для них идеологией борьбы с коммунизмом. Возглавлял эту группу Константин Родзаевский. Молодой оратор, зажигающий людей своими речами, открыто поддерживал гитлеровскую идеологию национал-социализма. Он быстро поднялся по карьерной лестнице и стал лидером Российской фашистской партии в Харбине.\n\nКогда Советский Союз рухнул, изгнанники увидели возможность по возвращению Родины и поспешили нанести удар. При поддержке Японии Родзаевский возглавил вторжение на Дальний Восток России, заявив о своем намерении воссоединить нацию и создать новую эру русского национал-социализма. Завоевание отлично продвигалось, пока Родзаевского на предали две противоборствующие группировки. Офицеры белой армии каждый раз открещивались от фашизма, по ходу войны они воспользовались возможностью, и освободились от ненавидимого ими правления, присягнув Лже-царю в Чите. В это же время в Магадане взбунтовался Михаил Матковский, давний соперник Родзаевского внутри РФП. Он выступил против лидерства Вождя заявив, что Родзаевский был не более чем марионеткой нацистов, ведущих геноцид, и предателем российской нации. Теперь в управлении у Всероссийского Правительства остался крохотный кусочек земли. Сам Родзаевский пока лишь выжидает момента, когда он сможет вернуть то, что по праву принадлежит ему, и преподаст урок предателям, который они не забудут."
 
 BRY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Yagoda and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in Irkutsk seem to have learned nothing from the fall of Bukharin's Union. They insist they are the true heirs to Lenin's revolution while the NKVD snuffs out all intra-party criticism. Worse yet, they stifle the local Buryat people's autonomy under a Russo-centric hegemony. After years of Yagoda's tyranny, the various dissidents within his fiefdom have risen up to overthrow him and his Presidium.\n\nThey have rallied around the charismatic young idealist Valery Sablin, a passionate Leninist who has called for true freedom and equality for all the peoples of Russia. Everyone from Bukharinites distressed by growing NKVD control, Buryats who desire autonomy, junior officers and women who seek equality have joined his mutiny. But when Sablin wins - if he wins - he will have to come face to face with pragmatic challenges of governing a state. Will Sablin's Union live up to Lenin's ideals? Or will it backslide into Bukharinist dictatorial pragmatism?"

 IRK_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Когда режим Бухарина рухнул во время фашистского натиска, а сам он исчез посреди всеобщего хаоса, генеральный комиссар госбезопасности Генрих Ягода мобилизовал оставшиеся дивизии НКВД для эвакуации Президиума Верховного Совета СССР на восток, в Иркутск. Отсюда остатки бухаринского правительства попытались восстановить свой контроль над Дальним Востоком. Но вскоре их власть пошатнулась, ибо обширные территории начали брать под свой контроль начали брать коллаборационисты и предатели. Вскоре после этого Ягода потерял свою уверенность в компетентности партии и начал передавать государственные механизмы под прямой контроль НКВД, вопреки желаниям Президиума.\n\nЛегитимный наследник Советского Союза находится в шатком положении. Лоялисты Ягоды и партийные аппаратчики раздирают государственный аппарат в борьбе за власть, и, если этого было недостаточно, в это же время бывший комиссар Валерий Саблин поднял восстание против центрального правительства в Бурятии. Если Ягода надеется на восстановление Советского Союза, то ему необходимо быстро разобраться с мятежом."
 
 MAG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Since the birth of the Russian Fascist Party Mikhail Matkovsky competed with Konstantin Rodzaevsky for control. Rodzaevsky was aggressive and idealistic, and openly supported Hitler's nazism, while Matkovsky was more subtle and diplomatic, and saw the racial hatred the Nazis held for Russians plainly. The two men often butted heads but worked together for the dream of a Russia free of Bolshevism. When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union that dream suddenly became a reality, as the RFP organized an invasion of the Russian far east. However, Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce national socialism even as the nazis carried out a genocide against the Russian people was the breaking point for Matkovsky. He knew that Germany would never tolerate a strong Russia, even a fascist one, and Rodzaevsky was only leading the nation towards suicide.\n\nMatkovsky and his supporters took control over the port of Magadan and declared that Rodzaevsky was a traitor to the motherland, and only Matkovsky would be able to reunite Russia under true fascism. Matkovsky's clique has now spent years preparing to strike south and finish Rodzaevsky once and for all. Resources in Magadan are scarce, forcing Matkovsky to turn to unusual sources of help. Mercenaries from all over the world have come to Magadan seeking fame and fortune, but the greatest source of support lies across the Pacific: the United States. Persuading the Americans will be no easy task, but if anyone can do it, it is Matkovsky."

 WCH_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "For many of the Russian exiles in Harbin, the rise of the Russian Fascist Party was a godsend. For the officers of the White Army in the city it was a nuisance. They had spent years fighting to restore the Romanov dynasty to their rightful throne, only to see the exile community abandon the monarchy for this distasteful new ideology. The old generals, led by Ataman Semyonov, reluctantly agreed to work with Rodzaevsky and the RFP more out of mutual hatred for the Bolsheviks than anything else. When the nazis invaded the Soviet Union and it became clear Hitler was not waging war against communism, but against the Russian people, the generals were appalled by Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce nazism. It was decided that the partnership could not last, but the generals would wait to split until the time was right.\n\nThat time came shortly after Rodzaevsky launched his invasion of the Russian far east. The white officers invited Prince Michael Romanov to a dinner party in Harbin. Once there they involved him in all of their schemes, declaring that they would crown him as the new Tsar and retake his empire. Both Prince Michael's reluctance to join their cause and ineligibility for the throne failed to dissuade them. Soon Semyonov's clique had seized the city of Chita, denounced the RFP and declared their loyalty to the newly crowned Tsar. Free of Rodzaevsky's control and back on Russian soil, the officers are now preparing to destroy the fascist remnants and reunite Russia in the name of Tsar Mikhail II, whether he wants it or not."
