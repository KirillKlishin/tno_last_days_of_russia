 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BORIS_PASTERNAK_DESC:0 "Boris Leonidovich Pasternak is not a politician by trade, but rather a poet and a scholar. A Muscovite of Jewish ancestry, he quickly became renowned in the early days of the Soviet Union for his collections of poetry and translations of English and German classics. However, his early admiration for Lenin soon wore out, and he found himself scrambling to try and get friends and colleagues off of blacklists and out of prisons. Pasternak, despite his reputation suffering, never saw official censure or persecution himself, as many within the Politburo and NKVD viewed him as too passive and detached from reality to pose a political threat. As the Germans marched closer to Moscow, Pasternak and the remnants of the Soviet intelligentsia fled to the east, with many taking refuge in the city of Tomsk. There, they decided to draft a liberal constitution inspired by the undying Russian democratic thought and pledged to restore the freedom of expression that they craved under Soviet rule. Their cause gave a birth to the Central Siberian Republic, which proved itself to be a worthy foe to the declining dictatorship of the Far Eastern Soviet state, but soon collapsed under its own weight, unable to cope with ambitions of their own generals.\n\nPasternak now rules a state dominated by intellectuals and artists, full of thinkers and poets. Although he and his colleagues give wonderful speeches, draft laws that are fascinating to read, and compose beautiful anthems, their only previous experience in holding office has been on university faculties. Whether Pasternak and his nation of dreamers will achieve anything or be content to sit in their ivory towers is a question that has yet to be fully determined."

 POLITICS_DMITRI_SHOSTAKOVICH_DESC:0 "As with all symphonies, the new life of Dmitry Dmitriyevich Shostakovich started with a single sound: the chime of a telegram. Punctuated with sudden stops, the little piece of paper brought to him brief but grim news: Leningrad had fallen to the hands of the Nazis. He was attending a recital in Tomsk, in honor of an old friend. With his home lost and with no transport westwards, Shostakovich became stuck in the city, earning his living as a composer of eccentric repute in the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nThus began the Larghissimo of Shostakovich's life. A slow and ponderous walk across the years of the Republic, with almost nothing notable occurring in-between. He turned to his work, composing pieces that subtly criticized the Republic, and integrated himself into the artistic scene of Tomsk. When he found himself at the forefront of the Humanist Association, he had reached the Andante of his movement: a stable, forward pace.\n\nHowever, such a steady tempo would not last forever. Rebellions shattered the old Republic, with Novosibirsk tearing itself away over the issue of conscription. It opened to a chaotic second act: the anarchists rose in Kansk, and the generals mutinied in Krasnoyarsk. The denouement rested in Tomsk, where the ideals of the Republic survived and thrived. The artistic movements of the city, now Salons, thrived.\n\nThe lands of Central Siberia are to witness a new play fold out. With his triumph in the elections of the Republic, Shostakovich now stands to conduct it. The world awaits to see if his victory is merely an overture or the end of a beautiful coda."
 
 POLITICS_DANIIL_KHARMS_DESC:0 "Daniil Kharms - originally Daniil Ivanovich Yuvachev, before embracing his pen name - is not the kind of man anyone envisioned leading a nation. A stalwart of the Leningrad avant-garde movement, Kharms achieved only limited local recognition in the interbellum years. Known primarily for his children's literature, Kharms also wrote an extensive corpus of absurdist work that found favor with dissidents and irritated the revolutionary establishment to no end. His career was cut short in 1941 by his arrest and commitment to a psychiatric institute in Leningrad. He might have died in the following siege, if not for a sympathetic guard's kindness. An absurd miracle, for a writer of the absurd.\n\nThat Kharms has fallen in with the Bastillards is a surprise only to those unfamiliar with his work. Through metaphor and various other literary devices, he has made clear his ideological peculiarities: the sublimation of coarse, unbidden desires, and the importance of remaining human in a world fallen to animalistic barbarity. Not the most orthodox of men to lead a law-and-order party, but who's to say what's 'orthodox' these days?"

 POLITICS_ANDREY_SAKHAROV_DESC:0 "Один умный человек когда-то сказал: "Истина никогда не бывает простой." Этим человеком, конечно же, был Андрей Дмитриевич Сахаров. Рождённый в семье интеллигентов, он нашёл спасение в науке. Приходилось подчиняться и молчать, оставалось множество невысказанных замечаний в адрес "идеологически правильной" Академии Наук, но это было необходимо для выживания.\n\nПосле падения советской власти Сахаров вместе со своими вещами переехал в Томск. Его технократические взгляды свели его с сообществом таких же технократов, объединённых в салон Модернистов. Верящий в силу науки и знаний и закладывающий основы будущего Сахаров как никто другой представляет идеализм Томска и его жителей."
 
 POLITICS_DMITRY_LIKHACHYOV_DESC:0 "Of all Russia's cultural heroes, the Decembrists could ask for none better than Dmitry Sergeyevich Likhachyov. A true child of European Russia, Likhachyov's passion for literature became his career at the tender age of 16, when he entered Leningrad State University. Arrested by the secret police in 1928 for nothing more than alleged involvement in a literary group for students, he was exiled without trial to the Solovetsky Islands, where he would spend five years in a gulag. He narrowly avoided execution, and then nearly a decade later lived through the siege of Leningrad, being one of the lucky few to slip through German lines along with his family.\n\nResurfacing in Tomsk some time after the war, Likhachyov became a devoted friend and follower of Pasternak, and soon joined the Decembrists. With the old poet's passing, Likhachyov has become their de-facto leader. Espousing a truly European vision of Russia, proud of its heritage, history and diversity, he would see Tomsk lead the Motherland into a golden age of peace, cultural growth and friendship with the West."

 POLITICS_MIECZYSLAW_WEINBERG_DESC:0 "When Mieczysław Weinberg began his rise in the CSR's politics, many surmised that the Jewish composer from Warsaw would struggle to step out from his mentor Shostakovich's shadow. After all, the talented musician's work, too, had thus far failed to earn their own place, independent of Shostakovich's orbit. However, just as his works had acquired fans of their own, Weinberg's political ambitions earned the rising star of the Humanist Salon his own place in the limelight. A patient, detail oriented introspective man, Weinberg excelled in negotiating with other Salons, as well as in coordinating the Humanist's famously decentralized political organization.\n\nNow president of the Republic, Mieczysław Weinberg brings his own influences and impact on the Humanist Project. His family consumed by the anti-Semitism of the century, his homeland of Poland fallen to the fascist threat, Weinberg knows the stakes of his presidency all too well; Tomsk's dream of a free Russia, a shining light of freedom and progress, cannot be allowed to wither. A better future must be built for all, and defended vigorously. From investing in infrastructure to connect the people better, to continuing Shostakovich's drive to educate the workers, to expanding Tomsk's direct democratic traditions, President Weinberg seeks to teach the lessons of a century marred by sorrow, that have shown again and again the importance of hope and courage."

Popularly elected legislatures are too easily swayed by populism and demagoguery, whereas appointed legislatures are callous and distant from the common man.\n\nAs such, the Decembrists have modelled their Duma on a Bicameral model.\n\nA lower house elected by the people is able to propose laws that are then analysed by an appointed upper house. The upper house's powers are constrained, and its members are some of the Republic's most respected citizens, from all political origins."

The democratic process is set to distil the population's will!"

The best and most capable layer of candidates will be given the right to run for political offices, and present their projects to the people. This Duma of experienced public servants will work hard to fulfill their pledge to the electorate!"

As such, their constitution has designed a Duma where the traditional bicameral legislature is flipped on its head.\n\nElected officials representing the people's will serve in a lower house whose duty is the analysis of laws proposed by the upper house.\n\nLaws carefully designed by dispassionate experts in the upper house may live or die under the public's scrutiny.\n\nBut never shall the Bastillard allow populists to introduce their poison into the Republic's bloodstream."

The Republic found itself as a bastion of democratic tradition, as it became surrounded by tyrants, sometimes coated in red paint, sometimes not. Even the writer-president himself was soon overwhelmed by the task of guiding the nation through storm after storm.\n\nNow in his seventies, Pasternak is an old and fragile man. Yet, at no point did he lose the respect of his followers, fellow artists or scientists. Being sick, he has enclosed himself in the presidential residence, writing - whether that is proposed laws and acts, or creative texts of his own. The people who have surrounded him are the very best, and have played an increasingly significant role in governing, but everyone knows that the days of our leader are numbered. When that time comes, we must be ready, and continue his legacy."

Only the most loyal, who in many cases had even followed him in his journey eastwards back in the days of the war, were allowed to participate. The Provisional Government, in its years in power, has thankfully managed to stay above the bickering between different factions and salons, paving the way to a Constitution and true democracy.\n\nWith his inevitable passing coming closer and closer, Pasternak has made his wish clear for the Republic. This Government's goal has been fulfilled, and a smooth transition to the intended system is ensured. Thus, the next step is elections, where the voices of the people will be heard. It is time to finally begin the process of disbanding this authority."

From his lavishly decorated house, and with the help of advisors, he has begun writing the foundations of a document to lead the country into the future. That document is the Constitution.\n\nA constitution is of the utmost importance for a state such as ours. Pasternak has only been left with one job to do, and that is to show the intellectuals and the salons the path to their dream through a simple manuscript. He has based it on everything from the laws and ideals of short-lived Republican Russia to the constitutions of the western world. Freedoms and liberties in expression and religion shall be protected, while the people will elect their representatives.

Sometimes, they would be built on their common profession, giving way to teams of poets, musicians, scientists and philosophists. Others were created on the basis of a common ideology or belief, many of which had a chance to be heard in the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nTomsk houses a vibrant and colorful collection of these associations, who hold significant sway on how things are run in the last remnant of the Central Siberian Republic. If the President is to finally dissolve the government and begin the process of transition, these groups will be critical, giving their support to the system and being the founding blocks of the democracy.

Thankfully, they all have one in common: their loyalty to an indivisible, democratic Russia, something that Pasternak's government believes in as well.

The citizens of the republic are divided, and it remains to be seen if the Decembrist' platform of respect for tradition and rural democracy will triumph over the Bastillard and Modernist's ideas of urban industrial renewal.

Between the west, between the east. Russia is a melting pot, a place where ideas are traded and where the people slowly incorporate new ways of doing things into their life.\n\nTo take a walk in the forests of Tomsk is to see why the Decembrists must lead the Republic.

The work of urban industrial workers is no less noble than the work their forebears did in the countryside. After all, hard work is eternal, and its applications limitless.\n\nThe Modernist and Bastillard societies, alike in some aspects yet dissimilar in others, have both made the life of urban workers the main issue of their respective campaigns. The Bastillards see in the urban masses a permanent dagger to the heart of the republic, and claim that a strong state is necessary to defend the republic.

It might have been an emergency measure, but to say that the average citizen could not decide for themselves the best courses of action in defense of their City was unacceptable. The people drew inward, becoming apathetic towards their role in a democracy, and a critical part of the ideals of the republic now lies again on its deathbed.\n\nShostakovich and his ministries aim to change this.

The production of guns, artillery, and ammunition must be prioritized if we are to maintain our freedom and independence of our nation. Without a doubt our enemies are just as surely building up their armies and military industries as we plan to. Additionally, if nothing else, the added jobs and fiscal stimulus should be enough of an incentive to go ahead with the project."

Not only does infrastructural investment provide excellent monetary stimulus for our economy, but it also also makes commerce easier to conduct in and around our lands, encouraging trade. It also eases the extraction of resources from our land. Furthermore, an investment into our infrastructure could also be considered an investment into our defense. The ability to move our military units into position rapidly to respond to invasion and raids is of the utmost importance."

While their work developing the nation is commendable, their understanding of the economy is by necessity parochial and incomplete. Only the government of the Republic can help steer the ship of state away from dangerous reefs.\n\nIt is certain that by rebuffing their help, we will lose some opportunities for development. However, we will assert that the Bastillard Society makes its own path. This will increase our political prestige and reassure many workers that our government disdains all outside concerns, not only the poor workers'. Only the will of our government matters, and as we develop our own institutional experience, we strengthen the Republic's foundations."

The workers of our Republic are not only earning a living wage for themselves and their family, but building the future of our nation.\n\nThus buttressed by material and psychological gains, the workers of our nation will bring the Republic in a new era of prosperity!"

However the years of chaos have prevented us from reinvesting much in industrial tools. To stop the waste of time caused by tools breaking down or needing increased maintenance, we must build a new generation of industrial equipment and give it to our workers. The upfront cost will be more than amortized over the coming years of improved productivity."

By promising a better future through current sacrifices, communists, fascists and liberals offer naught more than a simulacra of religion, bled of all its sacred traditions.\n\nThe Bastillard Society rejects ideology. Workers work hard simply because it is their station in life. In return the state offers them quantifiable improvements to current concerns.\n\nAs citizens realize that a non ideological, policy driven perspective is preferable, voter turnout will naturally lower and the Bastillard's non-ideological position will grow in strength. Demagogues might cry about the health of our democracy. We have more important concerns than popularity contests."

 ERS_universal_incorporation_desc:0 "Small businesses are the engine of the economy, moving nimbly into specific niches and sowing the seeds of future progress by the nation.\n\nHowever, many such small entrepreneurs are not as well versed in the basics of law. Many of our Republic's small workshops operate in a legal gray zone, without full incorporation. It is thus hard to keep track of who is doing what, and who is legally responsible when a problem occurs. Our supply chain's smallest gears are thus needlessly fragile.\n\nWe must help small businesses to incorporate, to rectify this issue. To encourage people to do things legally, a fund can be set up to defend small business owners in courts as long as their business is legally incorporated."

We have thus begun a new union, the People's Industrial Vanguard. This group's leadership, drawn from industrial workers and state bureaucrats, will apply rational economic principles to determine where the average citizen is missing needed ressources. Rights and privileges granted to industrial workers will be managed through back channels, to discredit mass action in favor of calm negotiations.

Incorporating several fall back plans in case something goes awry, as well as clearly defined targets, this program will aim to further integrate the nation's industry together and build a strong Republic.\n\nWhile the main focus of the three year plan remains to be chosen, the Republic can move forward with the plan's beginning!

Better public transportations can help workers reach their factories. New schools can train the next generations.

Mechanizing agriculture, teaching modern techniques such as new fertilizer and pesticides, opening new agricultural schools. All these will increase yield and prosperity within the countryside.\n\nAn additional benefit is that a prosperous peasant is a happy peasant. Were there any trouble to break out in the cities, we can be assured that our rural citizens would happily side with the party of order against any upstart revolutionary.

Our infrastructure is woeful, leaving our city isolated islands of civilization within the vast green sea of Siberia. We must repair crumbling roads, dilapidated railways and decrepit pipelines, before we do anything else.\n\nIn peacetime this infrastructure will help us develop our economy, and will thus be merely vital.

By infusing the zeitgeist with refined aesthetics and culture that glorifies the industrial worker, we will hopefully be able to bring new energy and vitality to the workers as we work to improve industry in Tomsk.

We consider unions to play a valuable role in the economy, shielding the common man from the rapacity and greed of the businessmen and tycoons of Tomsk. To that end, we have endeavored to bring into law a variety of legal protections for unions and workers in Tomsk. The most important of these is our protection of sector wide bargaining. Hopefully, by enshrining sector wide bargaining into law, we will ensure that companies deal only in fair and efficient bargains with the public."

In order to achieve such a goal, we will embark upon a large-scale propaganda campaign, using posters, radion, cinema, and anything else we can influence.

We experienced such a cultural shift decades ago during the reign of Bukharin as thousands moved into the cities to work in the factories. As Russia stabilizes, the city will again become the basis of Russian society, and when it does, there will be a flowering of urban intellectual culture unlike anything seen before in Russia's past. However, such an urban renaissance can only occur if we provide it the conditions to exist. To that end, we must build Tomsk into a world class city, or at least make it a rival of old Moscow."

The workers are working, industry is humming along, the new government and its agencies are working fine, and it seems as if the quality of life has started to increase for everyone. It feels like everything is going to be alright. It's been a long time since Russians have been able to feel this way."

 ERS_Expanding_the_Core_desc:0 "During the unification wars, our military wasn't as powerful as our neighbors. The fight against the separatists and the rogue generals was made difficult by our rump military. It has been a rough start for our republican army, but one that must be addressed if we are to defend the territory we have conquered and continue expanding. Our military deficiencies are many, and there isn't any simple fix that will rectify it.\n\nThe military as a whole must be strengthened. Marshal Shaposhnikov has put forward a set of recommendations, on which all salons have been agreed upon. Such improvements will be expensive and time consuming, but necessary if we wish to one day reunite Russia."

 ERS_Stronger_Armor_desc:0 "One of the most important lessons learned from the Second World War was the necessity of a modern tank corps. Panzers with more powerful guns and stronger armor than we'd ever seen before broke through our lines as if they were made of putty. We face similar difficulties today. The warlords who have managed to acquire some portion of the former Soviet Union's tank stockpile or figured out some way to produce their own are often the warlords causing us the most damage and casualties. An armoured corp will be vital in ensuring our continued military supremacy."

 ERS_Better_weapons_desc:0 "The rifle is the most important tool the modern soldier has at his disposal, and the quality of a soldier's rifle is as important as the training he receives to use it. Even the greatest soldier armed with a musket wouldn't be able to do half as much damage in the field as an untrained conscript with a Kalashnikov. The more lead one can saturate the battlefield with, the greater the chance that something or someone is going to be hit with said lead. Our enemies across the border are surely working on newer and more advanced versions of the rifles they already have, and if we allow them to advance significantly past us, we may find ourselves overpowered in the field."

 ERS_Improved_organization_desc:0 "Uniting our region of Central Siberia was no simple task. It required the collective efforts of thousands of soldiers and officers working in tandem in order to subdue the smaller warlords on our borders. The experience these soldiers and officers have gained thus far will prove vital as we attempt to improve our military in the future. We should tap on this experience through the promotion of our most experienced and successful officers and soldiers. Additionally, we should begin interviewing our soldiers to see what they believe needs improvement in our armed forces."

 ERS_Republican_Eagles_desc:0 "For decades, the Luftwaffe has unleashed hellfire upon our Russian brethren in the west. There isn't a single Russian in those lands without a story to tell about the bombings. Men and women swept up in firestorms in cities, villagers seeing their village entirely destroyed in single carpet bombing, oil fields alight for days after a strategic bombing. All stories that support the common logic; If we lose the war in the air we lose the war and we lose it quickly. Aerial supremacy is of the utmost importance if we are to reunite Russia and one day combat Germany. Currently, our air force is a joke. We need to produce more planes and better quality planes if we are to catch up, and we need to do so rapidly."

 ERS_Steel_Caravans_desc:0 "Every army marches on its stomach, and if you can't supply an army's ravenous appetite, it will die. Living in the rough and varied lands of Russia, logistics can be a major challenge. Supply lines often run long and snake-like, leaving them vulnerable to attack. The terrain and weather can also make transportation of materials and goods a slow and arduous task, with snowstorms and mud a very real and present threat. Mitigating these threats to our supply lines through the use of new technology is vital in this regard. Improved trucks with all terrain capability alongside trains which can pull ever larger loads will surely increase our logistical capacity."

 ERS_Duty_to_the_Republic_desc:0 "Our army is an army of citizen soldiers. Our ranks are filled with men of the common folk, not elites from fancy school with special training. These are men who are doing their duty for the Republic, many of them volunteers. However, with each war our ranks dwindle further, even as our enemy's armies swell to ever larger sizes. We must go to the cities, the towns, and the villages of the Republic and ask them to help us defend our democracy. Those we help must help us defend the country if we are to survive."

 ERS_A_nation_of_Yeomen_desc:0 "We are a nation of peasants and yeomen. The vast majority of our people live on farms or in isolated villages. This can make it quite difficult to call upon them for the military, for when a peasant with little knowledge of rifles or riflery is suddenly given a kalashnikov and sent into battle, he has just as much of a chance of killing his own comrades as he does the enemy. In order to rectify this issue, we will begin mandating a few hours rifle training every week for men and women over sixteen. They will be given rifles and taught to shoot at targets in local shooting fields. Thus, when the time comes for them to fight, they will be able to slip into the soldiers role with ease."

 ERS_Military_Education_desc:0 "Officers are one of the vital pieces of the modern military unit. His responsibilities include organizing his men, coordinating with other officers, and leading his men in battle. The qualities we believe to be of the greatest importance in executing those three tasks are initiative and creativity. Officers trained in our military academies have this idea of initiative and ingenuity drilled into them. For example, officers must be able to generate at least three solutions to any one test we present them, and execute it in a reasonable amount of time.There are hundreds of young, creative, and motivated soldiers in our armed forces who have the potential to be officers, but cannot afford the cost of schooling. We must make officer training and schooling available to these men so that we might capitalize on their skills and ambition."

 ERS_Principle_of_Directive_management_desc:0 "The worst possible thing a military can do to itself is implement a rigid chain of command with strict oversight, where every action must be pre approved by the man above him. It can allow one to exercise great control over their military, but it also ensures that your lower ranks will be essentially braindead, and will limit your army's effectiveness. Instead, one should encourage their lower ranks to think for themselves as to how to interpret or apply strategic directives from above. The officers and troops on the ground often understand the immediate military situation a lot better than generals miles away from the front lines do. If your men can't function autonomously from high command, then the second your men are encircled or communications cut off, they are as good as dead."

 ERS_Moderne_Amalgame_desc:0 "During the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars, the French military would often mix conscripts with their core army. In doing so, they ensured their conscripts would be brought quickly up to speed with the rest of the army, developing their skills through close proximity with experienced soldiers. We should endeavor to do the same, taking our conscripts and mixing them in with our professional army, bringing everyone up to speed on the front lines and saving the army plenty of time in training."

 ERS_Support_weapon_corps_desc:0 "The two single greatest military innovations to come out of the 19th century was artillery and machine guns. These two weapons together would prove to be some of the most deadly and destructive in human history, with a death toll in the tens of millions and climbing. The ability to bombard an enemy position from miles away or to saturate an enemy position with hundreds of bullets in a matter of seconds is an incredible advantage. We must train our men on the use and maintenance of these weapons, including them as part of our mandatory military training program."

 ERS_Military_healthcare_desc:0 "The men we have on the front line deserve the best medical care we have to offer. They risk their lives every day protecting us at home, the least we can do for them is provide decent healthcare. Additionally, in providing them better medical care, we minimize our losses and preserve valuable military experience that these soldiers accumulate on the battlefield. Even more importantly, providing them free military healthcare will boost morale in the armed forces, encouraging our men to fight harder and take bigger risks, knowing that they will be covered in the event of a medical emergency."

 ERS_Strong_Undaunted_Defiant_desc:0 "The Citizen Army stands strong! Following numerous reforms and expansions, we can now proudly say that our army is one of the greatest in all of Russia. Should any nation be so foolish as to attack us, we will have thousands of men, citizens of this great Republic, ready to crash upon the enemy like a tidal wave, sweeping through their lines and past them towards their capital. Should they survive that, our tanks divisions will pincer them from the sides as artillery rains down upon them like hail. Let it not be said Tomsk could not fight."

Our republic is real, with legitimate democratic elections, rejection of the one party state, and with freedom of speech and expression for all citizens. Sadly, ours is a unique path, and there aren't many who follow our ways. Hopefully, however, in time we will be able to spread democracy to all of Russia."

 ERS_Potential_Enemies_desc:0 "There aren't many democracies among the warring states of Russia. Most are communist one party states, facist dictatorships, or military juntas, and all of which are hostile to our continued existence. Dealing with these threats will require the finesse of diplomacy as well as the muscle of the military. Any nation on our borders could be a possible enemy, it's up to our diplomats to find out who intends to be, and our military to make sure that they don't. As we trend ever closer towards the inevitable reunification of Russia, our list of enemies will only grow. It's important we be prepared."

 ERS_Diplomatic_education_desc:0 "A republic only functions so long as the people stay involved and vote. However, this is only possible if the people stay informed. Too many of our citizens are either unaware or misunderstand of our foreign policy, with many believing lies about it in the absence of other information to the contrary. We should turn our foregin policy into more easily digestible information for the worker's consideration. We will explain our positions and reasoning for the actions we take with other nations on our borders and abroad, and hopefully our citizens will approve."

 ERS_Potential_friends_desc:0 "Though we are mostly alone as a social democracy in Russia, there are still many socialist nations who might be amenable to us. Our government is often more moderate than many of these socialist nations, but we are certainly more similar to each other than to the various fascist and despotist nations in Russia. We should reach out to these socialist nations, and should our meetings go well, potentially establish some mutually beneficial relationships. In these cold, sprawling wastes we call home, danger abounds across every hill and behind every tree. We would do well to have some allies."

 ERS_Central_Asian_Overtures_desc:0 "Are there any lands or peoples more intertwined with the history and peoples of Russia than those of Central Asia? For centuries we have traded with each other, fought against each other, and in past decades, with each other. These lands now lay as divided as Russia, but this state of affairs likely won't hold. There are various warlords and nation states who contend for dominance over the region, and who also might be acquiescent to an alliance or some sort of mutual defense pact. In any case, we must strive to appear as strong and favourable potential allies should such a Central Asian nation ever choose to support a contender for Russian reunification."

 ERS_Through_Cathay_desc:0 "As we march onwards towards the reestablishment of Russian power on the world stage, we mustn't forget the nations with which we are to share borders. To our east lies one of the strongest nations in all the world at this moment: Japan. Over the course of several decades since the beginning of the century, Japan has slowly but surely conquered all of East Asia, most impressively pushing through most all of China, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia during the Second World War. However, despite Japan's impressive conquests, its grip over Asia slackens. The Chinese giant stirs, and Japan may not be prepared for what it will unleash. We should endeavor to endear ourselves towards China and the Chinese nations on the Sphere's periphery in the hopes that we might one day secure an alliance."

 ERS_Toward_our_Destiny_desc:0 "Our Republic has surpassed any and all expectations others had of it. Time and time again, we have proven that not only is our way of government practical, but it is also righteous. We have conquered all of Central Siberia and in due time will move to conquer, whether diplomatically or militarily, the rest of Russia. Our march towards the reunification of all of Russia has now become, for all intents and purposes, unstoppable. Democracy will reign from Arkhangelsk to Petropavlovsk, and, one day, from Moscow to Vladivostok as well. Long live the Republic!"

Emboldened by years of independence, separatists, former siloviki, mutineers of Krasnoyarsk and anarchists of the SBA all mill around, uncertain of their future, and wary of our political system.\n\nOur innovative constitution is limited in some aspects, with its strict emphasis on the four greatest salon. At the same time, Pasternak's great constitution empowers us to experiment, to try new things, to welcome new ways of doing things.\n\nIf our great republican project is to endure, we must dare to dream ever bigger dreams, and inspire ever greater amount of people to believe in our ideals. The republic must endure!"

 ERS_Discord_In_The_Salons_desc:0 "The topic of how to integrate so many new citizens into the salon system has sparked quite the debates in the great salons of Tomsk.	 Some argue that the common constitution should be amended; others suggest political restrictions that would cast an ominous shadow over our democratic dream.\n\nIt is important to calm tempers and soothe the chaos within the salons.

We can further monitor the situation by putting dangerous parties and associations under police surveillance. This will go against our idealist principles, but be an invaluable source of information. Once a list of moderate and extremist factions is drawn up, we can encourage moderates to join the salon system, and try to eliminate extremist influence."

This prudence should not be mistaken for cowardice, however, as Dmitry Likhachov is preparing a powerful speech arguing for calm and determination in maintaining the Republican system.\n\nTomsk's elites, he argues, are used to steering the ship of state, and a great deal of new talent has been developed since then end of the provisional government. This elite has the backing of the people, as the Republican system and the free society on which it stands are a public arena for ideas. As long as the citizens show faith in their institutions and leaders, those who try to divide the Republic are sure to fail!"

 ERS_Modernists_Appeal_To_Reason_desc:0 "The Modernist society, rallying around Sakharov and Kamov, have published an appeal to reason. They argue that to panic is not befitting of Tomsk's leadership, and that the problem can be attacked rationally and efficiently.\n\nBy compiling information on new political candidates and attacking radical network of influence, calmer and saner candidates can be integrated to the salon system while demagogues and problematic politicians can be left to the wayside. The only need the Republic has right now, the Modernist argue, is for its leadership to maintain a clear head."

 ERS_HumanistS_Call_For_Compassion_desc:0 "The Humanist society has launched a series of radio ads, read by Shostakovich and Weinberg. The two friends beg the Republic's citizens to show love and compassion to the new citizens.\n\nMany that live in the new territories have endured years of dictatorship by radical elements. Now they are once more in the Central Siberian Republic, and are afraid for their future. Is it so surprising, then, that many seek extremists and demagogues as patrons? We should not begrudge drowning men and women for seeking ways to stay afloat. Rather, we should dive into the tumultuous waters and show our fellow citizens that there are few reasons to be afraid."

 ERS_BastillardS_Plea_For_Action_desc:0 "The Bastillard Salon has been at the forefront of the salon conferences in demanding action. Led by Kharms, the members of the Trinity Society have thundered publicly that now is not the time for indecision; the Republic fought hard to regain its former provinces. Now it must fight to integrate them, and to reduce its opposition to irrelevance.\n\nThe Salon system and Tomsk's rotating constitution are shields against extremism, granting the political caste supreme powers over proposing new laws to keep the Republic alive and strong. Now is the time to use these powers, to build a veritable rampart between the state and its enemies!"

 ERS_Freedom_For_The_Independants_desc:0 "The Humanist and Decembrist Salons have united behind a joint proposal to rewrite the common constitution to make it easier for properly vetted political independants to run under any salon of their choosing. The four great salons would still be allowed final say over their presidential candidates and policy platforms; however independants would be allowed to have full political career.\n\nThis proposal has been heavily criticized by the Bastillard for allowing populist poison to seep within Tomsk's system, and by the Modernists for weakening the party system. Nevertheless, the proposal is widely popular within the independent political crowd, and is likely to strengthen confidence in our Republic."

 ERS_Work_To_Integrate_The_Independant_Into_The_System_desc:0 "The Bastillard and Modernists, strange bedfellows as they may be, have countered the Humanist and Decembrist's proposal with a policy program of their own. Their joint program would see vast infrastructure investment in the new territories, allowing new citizens to get involved within the Republic's society. Over time their attachment to old ideas and old political factions would weaken, aided by the work of our intelligence agency in dissolving radical organizations. This slow way would in time reduce greatly reduce independant pressure on the Republic's systems.\n\nThis method, counter the Decembrists and Humanists, is little more than mass deployment of bribes and pork barrel spending, to buy peace from the new citizens. Nevertheless, the Modernists and Bastillards are forging ahead with their own campaign to see this new legislation passed."

 ERS_Advisory_Referendum_desc:0 "The common constitution allows for advisory referendums on thorny societal debates. A super majority of the deputies of the four salons now request an advisory referendum on the political issue: the referendum is to ask the citizens wether the Modernist-Bastillard program of long term integration, or the Decembrist-Humanist plan of independent political right is to be made the law of the land.\n\nThe campaign has spread throughout old and new territories. As mandated by the common constitution, the sitting President is in no way forced to follow the referendum's results. §RRejecting the popular will, however, is likely to have grave consequences on our legitimacy.§!"

 ERS_Novosibirsk_Conference_desc:0 "A great conference is to be held in Novosibirsk, under the recommendation of the Decembrist-Humanist program. There, independants of all sorts shall be brought within the salon system. Already a great number of political parties have come forward with candidate lists, applying for membership to a salon of their choosing.\n\nGiving out this much power to independants is likely to affect the political situation in the Republic for the coming years. To the plan's supporters, this is irrelevant. None should see their political freedom put on hold, no matter the circumstances. The nation trusts its people, and this trust shall be rewarded!"

 ERS_Integration_Bureau_desc:0 "The government is to go ahead with the Modernist-Bastillard plan. To help along with this, a new set of "Integration Bureau" will be deployed in all new territories. These bureaus will be staffed by neutrally appointed bureaucrats, and be tasked with aiding the integration of the new territory into the Republic's economy. Poverty, joblessness and political radicalism are to be fought hard against.\n\nThe Republic must do right by its new children. All shall be nourished, all shall be taught, and all shall be made proud to live in our great nation! Let cynics say what they may, none shall be left behind!"

 ERS_Dealing_With_Extremists_desc:0 "The government has now gone ahead with a program to tackle the political crisis. The wind has been taken out of much of our opposition. However, some determined critics of our Republic remain. Hardliner militarists in Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk, intractable critics of the late CSR, anarchists remnants in the far east, all united in their hatred of our government\n\nDiscord has once again broken out in the four salons over the topic of censure. Many argue that the Republic has no place for extremism, and that the voices of these enemies of the state should be silenced. Others point out that with our new approach to the political crisis, the opposition's power base dwindles day by day. Better to let the radicals rage to an ever shrinking crowd.\n\nThe President is likely to be asked to make a final decision."

 ERS_New_Friends_In_The_Salons_desc:0 "The four great salons have opened new branches all across the nation, and scores of curious citizens have begun attending them. Not all of our new residents find the salon system pertinent, but enough do that the four great societies have seen their membership swell.\n\nDozens of new thoughts, artistic techniques and political programs have begun swirling around each Salons. Despite the grumbling of the old guard, the growth of the salon system is in the long run the likeliest candidate to fully resorb the political crisis, and for that reason it could be a good idea for the central government to aid its spread throughout the nation.\n\nArts, science and politics shall be democratized! A new set of citizen assemblies are given birth throughout Central Siberia!"

 ERS_Resolving_The_Political_Crisis_desc:0 "Through cooperation and disputes, the four great salons have managed to weather this first political challenge to Pasternak's new republic.\n\nThe issues of independants politicians and of cynicism in our nation	are far from solved. Left to fester, these twin threats could end up fatally undermining our idealistic republic. This is no reason to despair, for our great democratic experiment also gives us the tools needed to weather this storm.\n\nWe must stand vigilant, remain true to ourselves, and open to compromise. Pasternak's legacy must endure, and as its guardians, the four great salons must constantly strive to rise above petty politics to ensure that the flame of idealism burns in Central Siberia!"

 ERS_The_Peoples_Spring_desc:0 "Is it not beautiful, what we have achieved? A government, beholden to the people and in support of the common worker, managing to carve out a place in Central Siberia. Years ago, such a thing would have been treated as no more than mere fantasy. A pipe dream, dreamt up in the ivory towers of Tomsk by the intellectuals with knowledge of the real world. Yet, here we stand today, able to proudly say that we are citizens of a free republic in Russia. Many of our citizens bled for this achievement, and many more will surely die in the coming wars to reunite Russia. However, at least for a moment, our people are witnessing a Russian spring blooming in Siberia."

 ERS_The_Great_Labor_Conference_desc:0 "The Great Labor Conference is upon us! Citizens, young and old, are invited to take part in a grand meeting of workers, industrialists, capitalists, and more! Discussion will be varied, covering topics such as the implementation of new technologies and labor practices in industry, the extent of government involvement in the economy, privatization of certain nationalized government assets, and the direction and focus of the national economy going forward. All are encouraged to come and impart their opinions and feelings on these most important discussions."

 ERS_To_The_Victors_desc:0 "In our conquests of the various warlords and statelets of Central Siberia we've come into possession of a great deal of industrial machinery. Much of it is still operational, and what isn't can likely be repaired. We must begin cataloging and redistributing this machinery. The lion's share of it will be given to the worker's communes for their use in localized production. The next largest portion will go to the government for our needs in construction and manufacturing. The remaining pieces will be auctioned off at low prices to the capitalists in the nation, bringin the government a small profit and the capitalists more means with which to produce goods."

 ERS_Rights_And_Duties_desc:0 "Every relationship in life is a game of give and take. The same applies to the relationship between a government and its citizens. A government is obliged to maintain the roads, work to keep the crime rate low with police, and protect the citizens from outside threats like an invading nation with a military. In return, the people are compelled to pay taxes, go to school, participate in the military, and most importantly, vote. So long as both parties continue to do their part and uphold the relationship, the nation will thrive."

 ERS_The_Great_Clock_desc:0 "The citizens of our great Republic can be considered as cogs to a great clock. Each one of them minute in nature, serving a purpose as inscrutable to them as the purpose of timekeeping might seem to the tiniest gear nestled deep inside the machinery of the clock. However, every one of those gears and cogs working to keep the clock ticking are as vital to the clock's function as the arms on the face of the clock. Each one serves an invaluable purpose, just as every one of our citizens does for our grand democracy. Everyone has a place in society, and every person serves to make our nation greater."

 ERS_Regional_Synergy_desc:0 "One of the great difficulties of Russian geography is how isolated our various peoples can be. Whether they be separated by mountains, forests, or just the great distances of the Steppe, it is often a laborious task to bring an item from point A to point B. Such separation and isolation of our population makes ruling over any great portion of Russia difficult, hinders our industrial development, and encourages separatism. In order to combat the various issues that arise from our isolation, we should begin patching the railways systems of our disparate lands into one large, cohesive railways system. Just as a seamstress might repair a sweater, we will sew our lands together with rail."

 ERS_Improved_Healthcare_desc:0 "If there is one issue on which most all citizens are united, it's that our healthcare system could be improved. While the mechanism that provides the insurance and funding for healthcare is functional, the hospitals themselves are grossly out of date and in need of renovations. Machinery that's decades old, medicine that's long since expired, and far worse have been discovered in hospitals across the nation. While this may have sufficed in previous decades, we now live in a rapidly modernizing Russia where such inadequacy will no longer do. Hospitals will be allocated greater funding, and a new oversight committee will handle the further modernization of our nation's healthcare facilities."

 ERS_Family_Subsidies_desc:0 "Despite conjecture to the contrary, we are of the opinion that aid to the poor and ailing in Russia does more good than it does harm. By implementing a system of sustained fiscal stimulus into the poorest regions of our nation, we can raise the overall productivity and quality of life in those regions, eventually bringing them up to speed with the rest of Russia. By providing the poor family money with which to pay for their food and buy coal for their furnaces, we free up capital that they can spend on other products and appliances. By increasing consumption we boost industry, increase standard of living, and this upward spiral snowballs until the fiscal aid isn't even needed anymore."

 ERS_Guns_Of_The_Citizens_desc:0 "Our citizens are no strangers to the military. A good portion of them are serving right now, serving on the front lines or guarding the border, protecting us from whatever enemy might try to extinguish our light. A good deal more would certainly be willing to enlist and serve if not for one great problem our military has. It needs more arms. Guns, artillery, support equipment, you name it, we need it. Our citizenry may be ready and eager to serve, but our military just can't have them without any equipment. While we may be a peaceful people, our neighbors are assuredly not. If the need ever arises for a mass conscription and arming of the populace, we must be ready, which is why a large investment is needed in our military industry immediately."

 ERS_Bureau_Of_Military_Industrial_Development_desc:0 "Everything in warfare is industrialized now. Whether it be the truck one rides in to get to the battlefield, the scout plane one uses to scope out the battlefield, or the tank one drives to fight on the battlefield, all of it originates in factories far behind the front lines. One simply cannot do without these modern machines of war, and attempting to do so would be foolish. A new bureau is to be created which will manage the production and distribution of all the trucks, tanks, and aeroplanes coming out of those factories behind the front lines. Even if we can't beat the enemy with the quality of our weapons, we will at least be able to out-produce them."

 ERS_A_Great_Symphony_desc:0 "Our expert handling of the economy has resulted in a boom! Several sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, utilities, and finance have breached double digits in growth. With this explosive economic rise, we have seen a great deal of financial resources flooding our coffers. With these newfound resources, we can continue to invest back into our own economy, increasing quality of life, lowering unemployment, reducing crime, increasing stability, and boosting economic expansion in our country even further. A great symphony of steel and steam is coming together, and the changes this melody will bring Russia are unfathomable."

 ERS_Chair_Of_Economical_Research_desc:0 "As our national economy grows and diversifies, it will become increasingly unwieldy and susceptible to external market forces. The government has an obligation to the people to mitigate the influence and severity of these market fluctuations on the economy. Our method of combating this will be through greater integration and development of our domestic economy. A new governmental department will be formed, with the intent of further integrating our worker's coops, private businesses, and government industry. By encouraging further interdependence and communication between these sectors of the economy, we will be able to solidify our national economy."

 ERS_The_Decembrist_Forebears_desc:0 "The Decembrist Society takes its names after the original Decembrists, all noble veterans of the Napoleonic war. Just like our forebears, we shall fight tyranny wherever we find it!\n\nThe original Decembrist led and fought with humble Russian peasants. On the soil of Europe noble and common blood fell and mixed, drawing the two Russian societies closer together. It is time for the Republican army to adopt this ethos. Shaposhnikov's core army will lead thousands of recruits from all over the Republic in times of war. By supplementing our veterans in time of crisis with a flood of soldiers, we will be able to trap our ennemies between a hardened, mechanized anvil, and a vast hammer of artillery and light infantry.\n\nThe common people look to their political leaders in time of peace for guidance; in times of war they shall look up to find the Republic's elite leading them to glory and freedom!"

 ERS_Expand_The_Military_Academy_desc:0 "It is a grim business to study the dismal science. We cannot, however, let our enemies outdo us in the grim art of causing death and devastation.\n\nThe military academy in Tomsk will be expanded, and students of the military sciences will be incorporated into our army's planning. Modern ways of organizing forces will be analysed; new ideas about the distribution of support equipment at various levels will be tested; innovative ways to use psychology will be used to enhance the deadliness of artillery barrages.\n\nOur adversaries have oft mocked our intellectuals. It is us that shall have the final laugh when we unleash our mastery of the military sciences upon the battlefield."

 ERS_Clean_Conscription_desc:0 "If our army is to rely on masses of conscripts, it is important we make it clear to the people what we expect of them. Drafting peasants during the critical months of harvest, or conscripting urban workers haphazardly and making them lose their jobs are both ways in which the common man will grow to hate and resent military service.\n\nWe will maintain clear and accurate lists of men of military service age. From there, regional bureaus will seek to accomodate families and villages so as to avoid depleting local manpower in inopportune moments. Men joining the army will be given precise enlistment contracts, and none shall see their military service prolonged arbitrarily.\n\nIf we ask the people to give us something, the least we can do is be precise about our needs!"

 ERS_Special_Forces_desc:0 "Born from experiments in the Second World War, most modern armies feature at least some special purpose troops. Well trained and equipped with specialized equipment, special forces operatives can appear behind enemy lines and perform surgical cuts to enemy material and personnel. After all, an army operates in coordination, much like the human body. Is it so surprising, then, that the right cut at the wrong place can induce catastrophic consequences?\n\nThe Republic shall invest in its special forces, and incorporate elements from special force training into regular forces. Far better after all to experiment novel tactics with small groups of smart and dedicated soldiers, before spreading information to the rest of the army."

 ERS_A_New_Cavalry_desc:0 "Marshal Shaposhnikov's modernization and mechanization of the Republican Army has united several excellent veteran battalions into the embryonic form of a respectable armored corps. It is now time for us to build on his efforts and develop a formidable group of armored divisions! These soldiers will form the spearhead of the Republican Army; clad in steel and equipped with devastating fighting power, this modern cavalry will be a formidable asset for our army.\n\nSome question the idea of putting most of our veteran soldiers in armored divisions. The Decembrist society believes that the force multiplication of mobility and firepower will be best applied by our best soldiers. The versatility of our tank divisions will allow us to reinforce failing defenses as well as strike vulnerable ennemy position at rapid speed. Let us renew the awe inspiring shock of the cavalry of old!"

 ERS_Skirmishers_desc:0 "The illusions of the modern landscape reveal themselves a few hundred meters beyond roads and railways. Hills, forests, rivers and swamps make progression through nature unaltered a difficult proposition.\n\nFortunately, the common Russian peasant makes a living from his comprehension of the environment. Many citizens from the countryside are used to exploring forests looking for mushrooms or animal meat. In winter as in summer, these hardy men and women travel across the land to make a living. Their experiences can be incorporated into our reconnaissance regiments. While we may not always fight in Central Siberian nature, the institutional attitude of being prepared for anything will let our infantrymen go where they please and strike the enemy wherever it is most advantageous!"

 ERS_Private_To_Marshall_desc:0 "Some accuse the Decembrist society of elitism, of fermenting a new nobility able to lord over the common man. We deeply regret this misunderstanding. As our Decembrist forebears once sought to break down the walls between common and noble folk, so does our modern organization strive to unify all social groups of the Republic.\n\nIt is this crucial that we look for talent within the ranks. Humble soldiers should not be precluded from leading other men if they show promise. No matter a man's social group, out in the field there are only brothers leading brothers to defend the republic. We shall promote the best of the best, and order our army accordingly!"

 ERS_Militarize_The_Elite_desc:0 "Russia has a long and storied military history. Its leaders were once expected to know military life, and it was a rare noble family that did not sacrifice at least one military hero to the nation.\n\nTomsk has had a reputation as a city of artists, poets and scientists within the CSR. It is time for us to trade the pen for the sword. For Russia to be saved and for light and hope to endure, we must accept into our hearts sorrow, hardship, and the possibility of death on the battlefield. By once more militarizing the upper rungs of the Republican society, we seal our covenant with the common people in blood. The blood shed by the enemies of Russia, and the blood that shall be lost in liberating it.\n\nWe must fight, so that one day songs and poems replace explosions and gunshots across the Russian lands."

 ERS_The_Republican_Artillery_desc:0 "It is the great axiom of modern warfare that firepower kills. The vast, vast majority of casualties on armies of the twentieth century result from artillery shells of various sizes, lobbed from great distance.\n\nThis lesson was taught to Europe by the little corporal himself, and a century later the armies of the Great War fielded gun batteries that would no doubt have impressed Napoleon himself. We shall place the Republican army in this tradition by maintaining a permanent artillery corp, to be placed at our conscripted infantry's disposal. The long guns of the Republic will be our infantry's swords and shields!"

 ERS_Towards_A_New_Patriotic_War_desc:0 "It was not the decrepit Habsburg Empire that ended Napoleon's rampage through Europe, nor the haughty militarist Prussians, nor even the sophisticated and modern British. The Grande Armée was fatally wounded by the Russian nation through its long advance through Russia and at the battle of Borodino, never recovering its prestige.\n\nIn the other Russian warlords and in the Wehrmacht we face a different, more dangerous foe. The former will stop at nothing to break Russian democracy; the latter will mortgage their own future if given the chance to finally destroy the Russian people. A new, even more terrible Great Patriotic War is on the horizon. One we shall win! Russia will never bend to tyrants!"

In the aftermath of the fall of Bukharin's union many assumed that the Central Siberian Republic would form the kernel of a new Russian Republic. When it too, fell, all wrote off the rump government in Tomsk as likely to fall within the year.\n\nNow the Central Siberian Republic is back, stronger than ever! The world shall hear of this good news, as we try to make the best of our isolated and land locked position to reach the wider world. It is time for a diplomatic charm offensive."

 ERS_Far_From_Friends_desc:0 "Europe is in agony, the continent of the enlightenment critically wounded by fascism, few nations spared from gangrene as the Third Reich agonizes. Yet, one beacon of the old West remains beyond the Atlantic, the United States of America.\n\nThe Americans are not perfect, and they are very far from us. This shall not preclude us from reaching out to them. Any financial aid or scrap of recognition we can deprive our rivals from will go a long way toward helping us reach the top of the Russian unification."

 ERS_Close_To_Rivals_desc:0 "To the east, on the shores of the Pacific, and to the west, near the great Ural mountains, various Russian states are emerging from the Russian Anarchy. Our intelligence agencies have reported a range of candidates for Russian unification, from professional remnants of the Red Army, to military juntas of the type we found in Novosibirsk, to thing as far afield as German death cults and theocratic popular uprisings.\n\nWe must be ready for anything. Being able to negotiate diplomatic integration of any moderate republic we find into our own government would be a great boon. Being forced in a fight to the death for the future of Russia would be of great danger to our mission. We must be prepared."

 ERS_A_Declaration_Of_Intention_desc:0 "Many we encounter have heard of the transformation of the Central Siberian Republic and ask of our commitment to Democracy and Russian freedoms. To clarify the purpose of our mission to expand the Russian Federation, we shall present a declaration of intention.\n\nAll of the salons in Tomsk fight to maintain the flame of democracy in Russia. Of all the political associations, the Decembrist Society is the one most dedicated to the people's freedom, to the respect of tradition and to the embrace of modernity and western ideas. Wherever the Republic meets friends of liberty, it shall embrace them with open arms. Our enemies should not mistake this kindness for naivety; the errors of the past have taught us well. All threats to democracy will be terminated in the appropriate manner, their perpetrators judged and reeducated."

 ERS_The_Northern_Path_desc:0 "It is not true in a strictly speaking way that we are a landlocked nation. To the north is the Arctic Sea, one of the hardest to navigate bodies of water in the world. Frozen most of the year, and barely reachable from the east or west, our distant northern shores are a mixed blessing.\n\nHowever, it is important we make use of all we have. Flying a great circle route over the northern Arctic allows diplomatic planes to significantly cut down their travelling distance. Local fishermen also extract stocks of food that can supplement our resources. Settlement like Dikson on the Arctic shores and villages among the Yenisei Gulf can serve as refuelling points for planes and ships in the region."

 ERS_The_Southern_Path_desc:0 "The recent years have not been kind to Central Asia. With the breakdown of the Soviet Union, the western parts of Central Asia such as Kazakhstan have fallen to warlordism and banditry. As to the east, Xinjiang lives haphazardly in Tokyo's orbit, its daily affairs left to local strongmen as has been tradition since the beginning of the Chinese Warlord era.\n\nCentral Asia is also one of our few ties to the outside world. Through Xinjiang we can reach the Sphere's leadership. To the west in resurgent Kazakhstan, local trade and air hubs have reached much deeper into the south, to Persia and India. It is a long path to the wider world, but one we have to traverse as long as the shores of the Pacific are denied to us. Time to start visiting local leaders with gifts and diplomats, to see what kind of deal we can reach."

 ERS_The_Russian_Federation_Is_On_The_March_desc:0 "The world thought us buried. Thought the Central Siberian Republic a failed state, a mere moment of calm in the chaos and horror of the Russian Anarchy. Thought the militarists, the anarchists and the other separatists had fatally wounded Pasternak's dream.\n\nThey shall dismiss us no more! The Central Siberian Republic of old was reborn in war, its egg warmed by the hope and determination of the common Russian people. Our state forms the embryo of a new Russia, one determined to fight for freedom and equality for all our citizens. Let our enemies quake in fear! Let our friends rejoice! The Russian Federation is on the march."

 ERS_Legacy_Of_The_Workers_Uprising_desc:0 "It's imperative for our long term survival that our citizens believe that the economy of our nation is fair and functional. The workers uprising was a direct result of our failure to convince them of that fact. Many of those workers that participated in the revolt had been exploited by the government and private businesses during our expansions on the Siberian Plan, working long hours and hard shifts, boosting overall production and mineral efficiency, only to get nothing in return. Is it any wonder they were so angered? In any case, we must begin to improve the economy and quality of life in our nation so as to avoid such violence in the future."

 ERS_Watch_The_Private_Sector_desc:0 "The private sector is much like a toddler, capable of bringing one great joy, but when not handled correctly can make your life a living hell, an outcome we'd much like to avoid. As we attempt to reform the economy and implement good policy, we must be cognizant of the ever ravenous and greedy businessmen in the private sector. If, during our attempts to deregulate the market or implement new taxation policies, we leave even a minor loophole or misplaced comma, we could end up losing tens of millions of dollars. We mustn't let the private sector get ahead of us."

 ERS_Rationalize_Soes_desc:0 "The government and a large and unwieldy thing. Like a giant, its motions are clumsy and sweeping, and often inefficient. Such is the case with many of the government's State Owned Enterprises, or SOE's for short. These government run organizations suck up millions of dollars every year, and we seem to have accumulated quite a few of them. It's time to cut back and slim down the government. We will have to analyze the functions and success of our various enterprises and decide what to merge, what to privatize, and what to close down."

Massive damage is being inflicted on our environment, workers rights are being abused, and poorly maintained, in some areas nonexistent, infrastructure is choking transportation around the nation. The issues presented have no simple solutions, and balancing the economy with other interests of the nation will prove difficult."

 ERS_Integrating_The_Siberian_Plan_desc:0 "The Siberian Plan was the final legacy of Nikolai Bukharin. In the final years of the Second World War and a few months afterwards, Bukharin had laid the groundwork for a massive industrial system to be created far behind the front lines and protected by the Urals in Siberia. Significant progress had been made with the plan, but ultimately, with Bukharin's fall, it was abandoned. Now with our ascent, however, not only will we finish what he started, we will use modern technology and industrial techniques to expand the plan far beyond what was ever planned for it."

 ERS_Environmental_Rights_desc:0 "Although the Siberian Plan has done much to amplify our productive capability and provide us an industrial base, it's also had numerous effects on the environment. Our scientists have noted increasing contamination of rivers, lakes, and other sources of drinking water for the public, increased rates of acidic rain, and vastly increased amounts of smog. Many in our salon have taken issue with the vast and increasing destruction of the environment that our industrialization efforts have brought, and demanded that action be taken. It may be time to take a stand on environmental rights and issue regulation to protect our natural resources."

 ERS_Workers_Rights_desc:0 "The delicate balance between worker's rights and business owner's profits is a fickle thing. While instinctively, one might automatically side with the workers, it's important to remember without the capitalists, there would be no investment into the economy, save government expenditures. However, treading too much on worker's rights could lead to riots, rebellions, and even revolution if we're not careful. And so the government walks this fine line, attempting to appease both sides and not hand to much power to either faction."

 ERS_A_Light_Touch_desc:0 "The free market is one of the most powerful and transformative forces on Earth. In just a few decades, the free market turned the backwater agrarian United States into a global industrial superpower. Being that Russia was first under communist rule and then unsplit between dozens of warlords, we were never able to experience these transformative effects. Now, however, we've reunited a significant portion of Russia and have built an economic framework in which the free market can thrive. It's time to sit back, relax, and let the free market do its work."

 ERS_Healing_The_Land_desc:0 "Decades of Luftwaffe bombings, wars, roving raider bands, and smog inducing industrialization has taken a mighty toll on these lands. Forests lie barren, destroyed by years of heavy fighting and destruction. The links of rail and road that once held the nation together are now disjointed and fragmented. However, it doesn;t have to stay this way. Peace and civil governance is returning to these lands, and so too does the opportunity to fix all that we've wronged. The forests can be regrown, and the new railways put down to sew the nation together again. What point is there in reuniting Russia if all that's left is ash?"

 ERS_Toward_Modernity_Confidently_desc:0 "The Russian peasant and worker is a cautious optimist. He must be, or else he wouldn't be able to survive in bleak lands such as these. However, in recent years, with our slow advance across Russia, he may finally have reason to be. Our state is a democracy, with liberty for all. Our industry is advanced, and sits atop the sturdy basis of the Siberian Plan. Our free market policies have opened the country to foreign investments and new technologies. Most importantly of all, under our rule, peace and civility is returning to his lands. The barbarous Russia of old is gone. A new, modern Russia approaches."

If our great republic is to survive, we will need to greatly expand our army and its capabilities. Though our small beacon of democracy has come a long way, the Unification Wars are far from over. As long as Russia remains divided, we must prepare for the possibility that, even against fellow democratic nations, we will have to fight. We must endeavor to field an ever more powerful, larger, and modern military, capable of dealing with every possible threat."

 ERS_The_Jotunns_Chariots_desc:0 "The future of large scale land warfare is in armor. Tanks, IFVs, APCs, and all the rest are increasingly going to become the standard in this mechanized world of ours. The advantage that thick armor and piercing explosives offer on the battlefield is immense, and necessary if going up against similar units. Ideally, by the time we confront Germany, we should hope to have fully mechanized elite forces to combat Germany's large panzer fleet. If not, we may find ourselves in the Second World War all over again."

 ERS_We_Fly_Where_We_Please_desc:0 "If we control the skies, we control the war. Unfortunately, we don't control the skies right now. Our air force is not only pitiful in numbers, but wildly outdated, with some of our oldest aircraft having been manufactured as early as the late 1930s. German jets and jets bombers are leagues ahead of ours, several times faster and equipped to fly at altitudes thousands of meters higher. We need to research jet engine technology and advance our air capabilities, if for no other reason than to gain a leg up on neighbors."

 ERS_No_Matter_The_Terrain_desc:0 "Historically, geography has been a major limiting factor in warfare. Assaulting across a river, up into a mountain, or into forests would give your enemy's a major advantage over you. This holds true even today, however, modern technology can help mitigate the problem. Come across a river? Deploy an AVLB. Attacking a mountain position? Use modern rappelling devices. Attacking into a forest? Use air cavalry to smoke them out. Better training and technology will ensure that in no cases will these natural impediments ever slow us down."

 ERS_The_Zealous_Elite_desc:0 "Instead of making an ever larger and more cumbersome military, we should instead be focusing on creating a smaller, better trained, and better equipped army. The advantage of this is that our forces will pack a hell of a stronger punch in whatever battles they are to fight in and will also take far fewer casualties as a result of having more experience and material at their disposal. Furthermore, we will be able to select only the best of our citizenry for the army, choosing only the most loyal and talented. Our new army will be fanatical in its defense of the republic, vowing hatred of the republic's enemies and accepting no failure or surrender in the face of overwhelming odds."

 ERS_Modern_Knights_desc:0 "One of the greatest draws of Knighthood for those in the middle ages was the prestige that the rank drew. Knights were elite forces, so distinguished as to be considered a form of lower nobility. We must do the same for our army. Serving should be thought of as the highest honor and treated with the highest respect. We should portray our army as accepting only the best, the crème de la crème. If we can convince the people of this fact, then we will be able to greatly increase the number of volunteers to choose from. After all, if the people believe a path to prestige and respect lies in service, they will surely enlist."

 ERS_Valkyries_Of_The_Sky_desc:0 "Air cavalry has proved one of the most impressive military innovations of the past several years. Used extensively during the South African War, their utility and efficiency has led to its mass adoption in major militaries across the world. If we wish to bring our forces towards military dominance in Russia, we should adopt this new and promising helicopter technology and integrate it into our forces. We have reason to believe that these air cavalry units will vastly increase our combat capabilities."

We dream of a future where the blue collar worker is as secure in his livelihood as the white collar worker, of a future where all humanity is united in democratic self governance. A lofty ideal to be sure, but one that may be possible in due time with the right allies."

 ERS_Render_Unto_Caesar_desc:0 "The greatest driver of any modern economy is credit. The ability for Russian entrepreneurs to be able to take out loans on the promise of future profitability for their companies is massive. It would spur massive growth in the economy as more secure foreign banks help Russian businessmen grow their companies and the overall economy to heights never seen before. However, this is only possible if Russia breeches the international financial markets. Our current credit rating is low amongst most major international banks, and they aren't willing to invest and possibly lose money on a nation in such a vulnerable position like our own. We work towards making friends in the financial community and see if we can change their minds."

 ERS_Cultural_Missions_desc:0 "Russia has been stuck in the 1940s for decades now as nations around the world moved forwards into the modern era of today. They have evolved scientifically, culturally, and economically in ways that seem radical to us. We should send our diplomats to these foreign countries to explore how their society has changed, and what changes we might expect in our own culture and society as we industrialize and shift into the global middle, and possibly even upper, class. Hopefully, such preparation will allow us to preempt some of the worst growing pains."

 ERS_The_Foreign_Policy_Council_desc:0 "As our nation rapidly approaches preeminence among the various Russian powers, we will increasingly find ourselves in contact with foreign powers, whether diplomatically, economically, or even culturally. We should assemble the greatest minds of our nation in a council to help chart a course for the nation in managing the interests of the various powers we will be working with and against in the future. This council will further help us to decide what kind of foreign policy goals we should have with our neighbors and interests abroad, like encouragement of foreign investment, technology sharing, and mutual economic agreements."

 ERS_Hoping_For_The_Best_desc:0 "Our state has grown strong as a contender for reunification, and many warlords have taken notice. As our armies continue their unstoppable march in nearly every direction, several smaller warlords have contacted us about the possibility of truce, or even a peaceful reunification. If we were to be able to negotiate the peaceful return of these smaller nations into the fold, that would greatly increase both our standing and the value of these regions, given that they will suffer no damage from war. We should open up diplomatic channels with these smaller neighbors and see what we might be able to do."

 ERS_Preparing_For_The_Worst_desc:0 "By failing to prepare, one is preparing to fail. Though we have only hopes of peaceful reunification, we must prepare for the possibility that negotiations will end in war. Plans must be drawn up for the various scenarios that might play out, such as a northern armoured assault or southern infantry thrust. Any good diplomatic negotiation is backed with the implication of a nation's military power, so we should have our forces at the ready on our borders. Should diplomacy break down and war is declared, we will be ready to move in at a moment's notice."

 ERS_Truth_Unshackled_desc:0 "Our republic stands for all that is good in humanity. We stand for truth, justice, and democratic self governance. There are nations and people in Russia who are fundamentally opposed to these concepts, who would seek for nothing more than to enslave all the people of Russia under a singular dictatorial rule. We are those who stand against them, the righteous and the moral, whose obligation is to spread such virtue to all of Russia. We will never Our foes cannot expect to hold us off for long."

A massive industrial complex, spanning the breadth of Siberia, complete with resource extraction operations, infrastructure, and modern factories of their time. Though the Soviet Union collapsed before any great use could be made of it, our nation happened to coalesce right on top of it in Tomsk. With the vast economic resources of the Siberian Plan at our disposal, we have a strong basis on which to form the rest of our modern economy."

 ERS_Talk_To_The_Worker_desc:0 "As we learned decades ago during the October Revolution, to ignore the worker and his needs is to invite revolution and bloodshed. We must consider what we can provide the worker, after all, all of our work in developing our industry, the Siberian Plan, and every other economic endeavor we've embarked upon has been for the benefit of the people. What use will it have all been if it's just the capitalists and industrialists reaping the benefits of our collective hard labour? In any event, we must be wary that the common worker doesn't get too displeased."

 ERS_Tea_With_The_Bosses_desc:0 "Just as we must not ignore the workers, we would be remiss to ignore the thoughts and wishes of the captains of our industry. It is imperative that we move forward developing our economic plans in tandem with the market so that our nation's businesses and economy flourish as we implement the Central Siberian Plan.\nLet's sit down and have some lengthy discussions with the most powerful businessmen throughout Central Siberia. If they bring a willingness to cooperate and a good faith in our desire to help the economy grow, we'll bring the tea."

 ERS_Hear_From_The_Bureaucrats_desc:0 "Above all, Central Siberia under our vision is run by and relies on our extensive civil service. In order for them to carry out the industrialization plan, we need to start assigning and delegating like crazy. But before we can rush into things, we need to hear what the situation on the ground is for our bureaucratic staff. Every last drop of information regarding the status of our bureaucracy and our current progress on industrialization must be submitted posthaste. Give us numbers, give us stats, give us everything you have! Move it, people!"

 ERS_A_Fair_Deal_desc:0 "We've heard from both workers and businessmen from all over Central Siberia. Unfortunately, as expected, their desires do not always overlap. In fact, there is a significant amount of conflict between these two groups, and we need to smooth things over as soon as possible.\nOur government is beginning to strictly enforce an extensive arbitration process that will hold hearings to resolve disputes between the workers and their bosses. Workers being forced to do too much overtime in the name of industrialization? Arbitrate. Bosses angry at their employees for demanding too much paid leave? Arbitrate. Any other problem? You guessed it: Arbitrate.\nBy staying out of these matters and allowing a neutral third party to resolve any and all issues, both worker and businessman will say we have given them a fair deal."

 ERS_Calibrated_Performance_desc:0 "The amount of numbers being crunched, buildings being constructed, permits being granted, goods being produced, and paperwork being filed is beyond overwhelming. In order to help businessmen, bureaucrats, and academics alike maintain and adjust ongoing plans as necessary, we will consolidate all of our data into one publicly available database that anyone can access. No doubt we will need to assign several civil servants to manage this data store full time, as it will be massive and constantly growing."

 ERS_Two_Years_To_Modernity_desc:0 "Great progress is already underway with the revamped Central Siberian Plan, but both it and our nation are rather outdated. If we want to someday become a great economic power, we will need to modernize at an unprecedented speed. Our government will invest in both public and private enterprise with the goal of promoting rapid technological development as a part of the industrialization project. Let's see just how many patents our entrepreneurs can file over the next two years."

 ERS_Ad_Astra_desc:0 "Central Siberia has developed beyond the wildest dreams of even Boris Pasternak! The factories are more plentiful and well-run than ever, the people's spirits and work ethic are at an all-time high, and the economy runs smoothly enough that somehow both the workers and businessmen are satisfied. Sure, we still have problems as you do anywhere else, but Central Siberia has become a bastion of material success and happiness in a world which sorely lacks both of those things. We have reached the moon; now, to the stars!"

 ERS_Cultural_Shift_desc:0 "Tomsk, and now all of Central Siberia, has already made great material and spiritual gains. But why stop now? We've already proved that modernizing our industry and culture has seriously benefited our society, so why not get ahead of the curve with our social policy as well?\n\nIt'll be ambitious, but we can create a culture and set of laws that guarantee our society accepts every single person on an individual level. This means increasing the rights and opportunities of women; they should get the chance to study and work too! It also means protecting the rights of other groups even if it isn't popular. We'll legislate protections for ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities, and even more controversially, our LGBT+ population. If something is out of your control or part of your personal identity, you shouldn't be discriminated against for that. Let's make Central Siberia the most modern and progressive place in all of Russia."

 ERS_Raising_Children_desc:0 "Everyone in Central Siberia has the right to study and find a paying and fulfilling career... including women! Historically our culture has strongly pressured women to remain nothing but homemakers while men have enjoyed the freedom of pursuing their dreams and cash to put food on the table.\n\nA free and universal childcare program will be introduced for all Central Siberian families, whether rich or poor, so that mothers have the same opportunities to learn and work as everyone else."

 ERS_The_Modern_Russian_Culture_desc:0 "Let's kick things up a notch and truly broaden our citizens' cultural horizons.\n\nWe've already modernized Russia's visual arts, theatre, and film scenes; why not encourage the rapidly evolving music industry, which is currently developing a new techno-electronic style popular with our younger population? Why not support new radio stations and hold music festivals? Let's upgrade our cuisine too! We can hold fairs and special markets featuring exotic foods, and demonstrating other nations' cultural traditions and celebrations to expose our people to a wide range of foreign experiences. The people of Central Siberia will be the most well-versed and culturally enlightened people in the world!"

 ERS_Rotating_Education_desc:0 "Part of the new, modern culture we want to instill in our people is a desire to learn and gain knowledge. So many hidden geniuses could be stuck performing menial labour for the rest of their lives because they have not had the proper educational opportunities provided to them.\n\nTo remedy this, we will initiate a rotating education program supported by both public and private institutions that will allow any worker who wants to do so attain an affordable higher education. We can always use more scientists, artists, teachers, politicians, and thinkers, but we can't expect the majority of those who live in Central Siberia to pursue these avenues without a little push."

 ERS_Republican_Vanguard_desc:0 "The Army is arguably the single most important apparatus of state. Not only does it protect the nation from outside threats, like the roving warbands of Russia or more organized hostile warlord states on our borders, but it also provides an important interior defense, defending the government from subversives within. These subversives may have any number of ill intentions; We know not why, only that they're there. They intend to subvert democracy for their own aims, whatever they may be. Only through the strengthening of the Army may we safeguard ourselves from these enemies, at home and abroad."

 ERS_Defensive_Doctrine_desc:0 "A declaration of war against our nation is simply the acknowledgement of a relationship our nations have already shared. There is no peace amongst the warlords of Russia, only prolonged truces. This is the mindset with which we must approach all our neighboring nations, be it during peacetime or war. Our nation will be impenetrable, whether to raids coming across the border during times of "peace" or to a full frontal assault during times of war. Every meter of land they take from us will demand thousands of their soldiers, just as every man we lose will demand ten more of theirs. We will make attacking our land as attractive a prospect as invading Germany might seem to Finland."

 ERS_Counterattack_Doctrine_desc:0 "Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength. Even if we can manage to kill an invading enemy at a rate of ten to one at all times, should we fail to seize the advantage and counterattack, we will inevitably lose. Enemy troops, fatigued by warfare, can be most effectively destroyed by rapid counter attacks by mobile forces. Their weakened troops won't stand a chance against the overwhelming speed and strength that our armoured vehicles and supporting mobile infantry can provide."

 ERS_Matryoshka_Preparations_desc:0 "You don't get to pick what bad things happen to you. An obvious statement, but pertinent nonetheless. At any hour, any or all of our enemies may choose to storm the border and go to war with us. We must be prepared for any and all situations that could come our way. Defensive lines upon defensive lines, counterattack plans for every possible nightmare scenario, a plan for every possible type of war that may come our way. It's far better to organize such plans now than to agonize without them later."

 ERS_Degrading_Enemy_Perforamance_desc:0 "One can't win a war hiding behind bunkers and clinging to WW1 artillery tactics. The French learned as much in the summer of 1940 when Paris first fel under occupation by the Germans. The war of the future will be fought with with highly specialized units suppported in the air on the front lines with CAS and behind them as well through strategic bombings, crippling the enemy's logistics. The enemy's units will hardly be able to put up a fight by the time our main army meets them on the battlefield should our elite forces and air wings be given the resources to do their jobs."

 ERS_Endless_Material_desc:0 "Material is cheaper than the lives of our elite army. We can use our vast industrial might as a shield for our troops on the front lines. Artillery shells will blot out the skies of our enemy as we obliterate advancing armies at a distance. And should these armies manage to get close enough to attack us, they will only be met by miles of concrete bunkers spraying out metric tons of lead each and every hour. Our nation's factories will put out concrete and steel until the whole of Russia is bled dry before succumbing to enemy invasion."

 ERS_To_The_Jugular_desc:0 "The German's named their tanks after panthers and tigers with good reason. Much like the fearsome feline predators, our tank's imposing speed and attack can rip through an enemy line with ease. We learned of their striking power years ago on the battlefields of the Eastern Front, and we've learned it here in the wastes of Russia again and again as we encounter ever larger and more industrialized foes. However, with our enemies bled dry of their equipment and manpower by the rest of our army, our tanks will know only decisive blows as we crush enemy resistance once and for all."

 ERS_Nothing_Is_Forgotten_desc:0 "Russia is not kind to governments that cannot feed the people. This is a lesson that the Tsar learned decades ago, as have many warlord governments since then. If the people are starving, then no amount of intelligence gathering in the world will feed them. Resources dedicated towards ensuring a continuous supply of grain, meats, and other foods will invariably go far further towards preventing the formation of a fifth column than an intelligence agency ever will. Only the most desperate turn to revolution to remedy their situation. If the people are never forced into such a situation, then there won't be any problems."

 ERS_All_Is_Known_desc:0 "Russian intelligence gathering operations are vital for our state's continued survival. Not only do such operations provide us with information on what our enemies are doing abroad, such as their planned invasion, technological developments, and political movements, but they also help to ensure domestic safety and stability at home. There are any number of agitators, dissidents and insurgents within our borders and even within our army that, should they be given the chance, would tear down everything we've created thus far. Our intelligence services must know everything to prevent such a thing from happening."

 ERS_We_Will_Bury_Them_desc:0 "Should our elite units in the army and the air force fail to subdue the enemy and our armies pushed back far into Tomsk, will will unleash our final weapon: concrete. Bunkers, miles upon miles of them spanning in every direction, blocking our enemies paths and corraling them into slaughterhouses of our own design. A wall of reinforced rebar unassailable by all but the heaviest and most powerful armored vehicles. More resources should be put towards our defense and securing our borders. If we can't drown them in bullets, we'll bury them in concrete."

 ERS_Western_Outlook_desc:0 "Russia's destiny is inextricably intertwined with the west. The west is our homeland, the homeland of all Russians. It is no longer tolerable to allow German jackboots to tread on Russian soil.

These lands are inherently Russian, and nothing less than their full return will be acceptable.

 ERS_Eastern_Possibilities_desc:0 "Although Russia's ultimate goal is to reclaim her western territories lost in the Second World War, we mustn't disregard our former holdings in the east. Vladivostok is a wildly valuable prize for us, giving us not only a port in one of the fastest growing economic regions in all the world, but also access to lucrative American ports and markets. Additionally, those eastern holdings could further offer us an entrance into Asian politics, which we might use to our advantage in further dismantling the already ailing Co-Prosperity Sphere. In any event, we should be standing at the ready to seize on any opportunities that may arise to liberate the Russian Far East."

 ERS_The_Waiting_Game_desc:0 "With our diplomatic office set up and relations established with our neighbors and other nations abroad, we now have the opportunity to begin running espionage operations.

Additionally, the expansion of our economy into Central Asian markets could make for some tidy profits on boths sides of the border. We should attempt to make contact with some Central Asian businessmen and see if they wouldn't be too opposed to establish trade relationships with us."

 ERS_Rising_Sun_desc:0 "Although Japan was never considered to be as great a threat to Russian sovereignty as Germany, they still remain one of the world's few superpowers and their Sphere shares with Russia one the longest borders of any nation on Earth. We should send some diplomats to Tokyo and see what exactly they think of us, and determine whether or not they are a threat. Perhaps, if our initial meetings go well, we may well even be able to set up an embassy and parlay our talks into greater discussions about Vladivostok and its potential future ownership."

 ERS_The_Failing_Eagle_desc:0 "Germany is a nation far gone. Years of economic failure and a recent civil war have made Germany into a shadow of what it once was, yet they remain one of the greatest threats to a reunified Russia's survival. Given that our republic has been fighting off warlords for several years, focusing mostly on day to day survival in Siberia, our knowledge on the specifics of Germany and the Pakt are rather limited. We must endeavor to learn as much as we can about the dying empire and its vassal states, as well as how we can exploit its weaknesses for our own gain."

Instead of having the government build new factories and set higher quotas for state owned enterprises, our friends instead suggest that we instead invest those resources we'd put aside for that into the free market. The funds would be used to prop up new businesses in our nation and give it a boost after the destruction of recent wars and revolts."

 ERS_Exporting_Synthetic_Culture_desc:0 "What's to stop us from synthesizing a culture all our own? We control the state, and with that power we also gain the ability to influence the nation's culture, more specifically the worker's culture. Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to begin promoting Protestant style work ethic with Confusion obedience and Soviet worship of industry. Indeed, we should hope that such encouragement of this synthetic culture will bring about more productivity amongst our citizens and work to further increase the efficiency of the state."

 ERS_Legacy_Of_The_Three_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The bureaucrats in our government are working diligently to design our next three year plan to further develop the economy. While convincing arguments have been made in favor of investing government resources into furthering the free market as opposed to the centralized economic apparatus we currently maintain, we are of the position that until Russia is unified under one government, state control of vital industries like the military industrial complex is necessary. When our nation is safe from the constant threat of invasion it currently languishes under we might consider privatizing some industry and opening up the markets, but until then the centrally planned economy will remain."

 ERS_Convert_Friendly_Unions_desc:0 "There are a variety of independent unions operating in several sectors of the economy in our country. From steelworking to transportation to agriculture, there's a union for it. These unions are disparate and limited in their bargaining power. As part of our domestic policy, we have begun pushing for larger state run unions to organize and control the various local unions being run across the country, which would help to strengthen the worker's cause overall. Though there are many unions that reject the idea wholeheartedly, there are others that have been swayed by the arguments of a national union backed by the government and supported by government funds. We should endear ourselves to these unions and encourage them to join."

 ERS_Making_Use_Of_Dirigiste_desc:0 "The new lands and territories we've acquired in recent years are vast, and brimming with people. Organizing and ruling over these lands with our current administration is proving greatly problematic. Not only is our staff too limited to handle the paperwork and bureaucratic load these lands have put on our shoulders, but we are also finding that the new bureaucrats we have managed to bring on board to manage these lands have been entirely incompetent. There are many former leaders and bureaucrats from the warlord governments we previously conquered with the experience and intelligence needed to effectively administer our new territories. We should seek them out and bring them on board. If nothing else, it should help us to better integrate these new territories, by offering them leaders of their own people."

 ERS_Learning_From_Foreign_Corporations_desc:0 "The unification of our region of Russia has brought about an economic boom. The peace and stability we've brought to our homelands has improved investor's faith in the economy and has encouraged young entrepreneurs to begin building their own companies. These new companies are going to be competing with foreign corporations with stronger logistics, better management, and lower production costs. If our domestic companies are to survive, they will need to emulate these foreign corporations in everything mentioned before. We will not become another market to exploit."

 ERS_Tailor_Welfare_Net_desc:0 "The government only has so many resources, and although we'd love to be able to support everybody, choices must be made concerning who gets what and how much they get. A new administrative welfare body has been assembled to assist us in that regard. It will aid us in determining what populations have the greatest need for aid, and what form that aid will take. In some cases, a financial stimulus is needed to lift a region out of poverty, and in others, it might be the construction of new soup kitchens and homeless shelters. By targeting exactly what is needed in our varied population, we will maximise efficiency and quality of life."

 ERS_Stamping_Out_Dangerous_Ideologies_desc:0 "While an educated, conscious, and politically free citizenry is important for any good democracy, there must be limits as to the ideologies we allow to operate within the country. Dangerous ideologies like Marxism and Fascism led to the oppression and murder of millions. These ideologies have served as a net negative for society and have actively worked to bring humanity backwards. It would be both irresponsible and careless to allow such ideologies to manifest themselves within our populace, and steps should be taken to ensure such a situation never occurs."

 ERS_Expanding_Our_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Our republic is growing and changing at a rapid rate, and our bureaucracy needs to get bigger if we are to handle it. We recently quadrupled our population during the reunification of Central Siberia, increasing the need for bureaucrats that can manage these new peoples, and have also been implementing more encompassing welfare and labour policies which will require a larger bureaucracy to run and operate. As the republic grows, so too must we if we are to sate the administrative and logistical needs of this nation."

 ERS_The_Expanded_Trinity_Association_desc:0 "The Bastilliards are, and have always been, a hub of thinkers and industrial planners. A sense for the practical paired with a little idealism can go a long ways towards making what might seem like dreams into reality, and what dreams we've had. We've brought our republic from a weak warlord state of the fringes of Siberia into one of the foremost contenders for Russian dominance, and people have taken note. All manner of thinkers and highly skilled professionals have flocked to the party of rationality and intellectualism. The Bastilliards have become the golden standard for how a government should be run in Russia."

 ERS_humanist_the_pacific_shores_desc:0 "Now that we have unified the Far East and Central Siberia, we are no longer fenced in. Our Republic stretches from Lake Baikal to the Pacific, and now we can finally start to begin trade with the outside world more easily. Our economy itself shall grow due these newfound advantages such as the Port of Magadan and Vladivostok.\n\nWith these ports under a unified republic that has consolidated its power, we can begin to expand our knowledge of the world. We can also begin to contact the great powers of the world such as the United States, the leader of the free world and the OFN. Possible trade ties could begin between our nation and theirs benefiting us both at the end of the day. Our nation can finally throw off its shackles of being far from the sea and the world."
 ERS_humanist_uprooting_dogmatic_marxism_desc:0 "Marx himself was yet one socialist thinker, one that was too self centered onto himself and his teachings. While his methods and ideals have influenced us to an extent, the idea of dictatorship of the proletariat has no place in our society. One of the recently conquered states that we had liberated and brought into the fold has influenced from a Marxist society, we need to remove these influences.The state had gone through a civil war due to differences in the Marxist belief.\n\nTo some of the more extreme members of our country, this could be seen as an overreach by us. However this is nothing more than curing a virus that had stained Russia for many generations. Once we do remove his influence from the Far East, stability can take the place that these ideals had held in the people. The people may seem callous at first, but then should be more accepting once they realize the good we have done."
 ERS_humanist_expanding_worker_democracy_desc:0 "Workers are the lifeblood of our society. Our rule in Central Siberia was quite focused on the idea of helping the workers instead of oppressing them like the former rulers of Russia. Unlike the former Union, we have placed the utmost importance on protecting them with labor laws and unions. However, when it comes to the Far East, the lands that had been formerly ruled by a group of men called the "Heirs of Harbin" and the dogmatic Father, worker democracy is a non existent idea. We need to change this.\n\nMany of the former workers in this region had lived under the oppressive yoke of men who like to call themselves rulers while they couldn't give a single bit of pity to the man keeping the country afloat from his labor. We must take these old ideas and morals and toss them out. In our society, there is no place for this. It must be our goal to develop worker democracy in these regions for the future."
 ERS_humanist_advancing_our_projects_desc:0 "Before we had the power and the opportunity to reunite the east, we had far fetched plans that would help the region as a whole with great economic benefits, now that we have the resources and reach of the Far East. It seems that an industrial base was constructed by the former denizens of the region, but we can always improve on this. The Central Siberian Plan, while helping our region Siberia, the east was much more neglected by these plans.\n\nAlong with these advancements in technology and our project, we can also begin reforms in the many cities and regions we have under our control, such as Magadan and Buryatia. They had been exposed to extremist methods such as Leninism and Facism. We must reform these regions to guarantee a hopeful future."
 ERS_humanist_the_peoples_war_desc:0 "While some of the more advanced and developed nations may disagree with the idea of a mass citizen army, if we can train these reserves and the main army enough, they will turn into a formidable force. Some of our political opponents have opposed this idea due to the risk of an uprising possibly or even a stunning defeat caused by a much better trained opponent. However, this would be unlikely after our training regime has gone through.\n\nWe are beginning to acquire books from the West on military tactics and battle plans, using these we have begun to adapt them to the conditions of Central and East Siberia to help us win our wars. Along with this, we have planned to introduce new equipment that we have also shipped to us from the West using our newfound ports in Magadan."
 ERS_humanist_the_peoples_education_desc:0 "Education is the backbone of a successful country and society. While many of the more developed countries in the world agree on this idea, some in Russia had been opposed to this idea in the time after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Before the Central Siberian War, we had preached the idea of higher education through our universities, but since we had regressed the idea in Central Siberia had disappeared while in the Far East it was nothing more than a dream.\n\nNow that we have control over Central Siberia once again, and now the Far East, we can implement our education reforms. While some of our other reforms may have caused rifts between the Salons, this would be one seen as a quadripartite effort between us. While the salons may have ideological differences, we can all agree on education."
 ERS_humanist_the_workers_economy_desc:0 "The Central Siberia Plan was a decisive action planned and executed by the General Secretary of the Soviet Union at the time, Nikolai Bukharin. The plan was to build factories and to reform the industry of Central Siberia. It had made us extremely strong during the post Union years, however due to the breakup of Central Siberia, we had lost quite a large base of our industry. We can began to rebuild these factories now we have control of them once again and now we can spread this plan to the Far East.\n\nAs we build these factories, many of them will be worker co-ops. As these factories will be owned by the workers themselves, who will vote on the many decisions that pass through them. This will in turn, make the factories more efficient and the workers more complacent due to them running the factory and not an issue of the state."
 ERS_humanist_the_grand_humanist_conference_desc:0 "It appears that it is time for us to pool together our great minds of the Humanists into one convention. Unlike many of the other official meetings we have held over the years, this one will encompass the entire country and we will be met with thousands of new members to the Humanist cause and even more returning ones from past conferences.\n\nUnlike many of the other ones, which had focused on our ambitions to rise to power in Tomsk, this one will highlight our current height of power and how we will expand upon these ideas. The central idea of this conference will be the expansion of the Central Siberian Plan, we will also announce our project that will modernize Eastern Russia. However, in this time, we also have been needing ideas for a project that all of the other contenders to unify the country would want. We are planning on asking many of the Humanists who come to the conference to pitch their ideas to use in these matters."
 ERS_humanist_the_tomsibar_plan_desc:0 "It is finally time for us to reveal our plan that we had made during the Grand Humanist Conference to the world. The name of it is the TomsiBar Plan and it aims to modernize Central Siberia very quickly.\n\nSome of the other salons will call us a hive of madmen for even thinking of this plan, however we are optimistic. The plan calls for three things. One is the development of "Hypertrains" these trains will use a type of engineering that was pioneered in Japan during the past few years. They will connect most of Central Siberia, turning it into a very connected region and modernizing it. The second is the increased connection of the many cities dotting the region, building more and more in between them to foster connection. The third and final phase, is the merging of the many cities into one "Megacity" that will serve as the capital of our country. This plan if completed, shall serve as the envy of the many countries around the world."
 ERS_humanist_the_capillaries_desc:0 "It's hard for us to claim to be interested in the wellbeing of our people when our cities barely provide for our people.\n\nInfrastructure within the few urban centers we have are a mess. The collapse of the CSR, infighting, and decay have all taken a toll on public services and roads. First things first, though. We need to repair and build seriously damaged and unusable streets so people can use them again. Whatever rail-ines, trains, and buses that are still salvageable should be pressed into service for the public, and for God's sake, someone get the water running everywhere?! Citizens living in the suburbs of our cities deserve functioning infrastructure like any other urban dweller."
 ERS_humanist_the_arteries_desc:0 "While local infrastructure needs a momental amount of improvements and work, we can not afford to neglect the major transportation links between our scattered towns and cities if the TomSiBar plan is to succeed.\n\nThe most efficient mode of transporting goods such long distances is by far by railines. We should make the investments and take the time to rebuild, repair, and place new lines so that all of Tomsk is connected. Improving our links will not only be great for the economy, but will also be vital for our armies; the lines will be of the utmost importance for moving our military across our state in good time."
 ERS_humanist_the_main_organs_desc:0 "The cities of Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Barnaul are currently our main centers of population and production. While they are the most developed regions in our state, compared to modern standards, the cities are archaic. Novosibirsk and Barnaul also remain some of the greatest beds of resentment against Tomsk's government\n\nWe need to desperately improve living conditions, industry, infrastructure, and human services in all three of these urban centers. The cities are too important to neglect, and their true potential makes them attract places to invest in."
 ERS_humanist_to_the_west_desc:0 "While we have successfully unified one half of Russia, another half remains under control by a separate nation who has fancied themselves a potential rival and even enemy if it truly comes to war.\n\nOur country must prepare for war, if it is truly needed. While we may not want to fight a potentially stronger opponent, we must make sure that we can stand up to them. However, if there is a chance we must prepare to have diplomatic contact with the nation in the west. We should consider all of our diplomatic options before even thinking about the option of total war. However, we must be prepared for this at all costs. Luckily, due to our ports that we now have under our control, we can finally import new weapons that are more efficient and more durable. The harsh winter in Siberia could be an issue if we must fight in it, so our soldiers and their weapons must be hardened for the fight. At all costs we must survive, but we should attempt the diplomatic route."
 ERS_humanist_neutrality_to_the_sphere_desc:0 "When it comes to the many superpowers of the world, there are three major ones. The Germans and their Unity-Pakt, what we can not join obviously enough. The second is the United States and the Organization of Free Nations. While they are the champion of the free world and many of our literature and other supplies come from them, they do not officially recognize us. However we can remain neutral with them.\n\nThe last great superpower of the world is Japan and their Co-Prosperity Sphere. While it seems that their power per day seems to be falling, they are our closest superpower. However, they seem quite fine with zero interaction with us or any of the conquered warlord states. While we may not agree with any of their policies, they will still acknowledge and trade with us, less officially like the OFN. Maybe we should not pledge our allegiance to either, but instead be neutral to them. This should hopefully make us more viable for new trade agreements."
 ERS_humanist_science_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "Due to Tomsk being relatively unscathed from the West Russian War and even the Central Siberian War in some places, we have our universities stand proud. However, like most things in Eastern Siberia, they could always be better.\n\nNow that we have ocean access, we can start to send letters to the many great universities of the free world. Places such as Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, McGill, all of them. Hopefully, if the students and administrators of these universities listen to our letters, they can start to send some of their knowledge they have in the many fields of science. Fields such as medicine, engineering, technology and industrial development. All of these fields would help develop our country further, in exchange, many of their students would be able to come over to Tomsk to help us develop one of our projects. If they wanted to, of course."
 ERS_humanist_russian_determination_desc:0 "Our armed forces must be prepared for anything. While we may not have the mechanized divisions like many of the other more advanced powers of the world, we have something they do not. Determined people who are willing to become soldiers to protect their home, and who are well trained. While much of our army is a mix of professional soldiers and worker units who could be raised if needed, we should train all of them more hard. We must be able to hold on against the onslaught of an invasion if possible to make sure that we can issue more men and women into our forces to be ready for battle. Due to this, our worker units will be reforged as a national guard type army. This army will live most of their lives as workers in our country, only training for one week per month or so. However, if our country is ever in a war, they shall be activated as a full combat unit and must be prepared to fight."
 ERS_humanist_heirs_to_1917_heirs_to_1918_desc:0 "Tomsk is a paradise in the Russian wastes. No other state cares for its people like us; our workers; men, women, and children are not disposable resources to be thrown away in pointless border skirmishes or raids. Our people are our future, and they should have a say in government. Tomsk and her people are one and the same; we must all work together to build ourselves a better tomorrow!"

Trading will be much easier now, so we should prioritize our relationship with the Pacific powers. We will need as much aid as possible for our plans, we cannot fall behind the West.\n\nAccessing our newly gained resources will also be very important for our growing economy. Extracting these resources for our industries will be needed if we want to compete with our neighbor to the west and finally bring Russia out of the past."

 ERS_modernist_integrate_new_assets_desc:0 "With our annexation of the Far East more industries, businesses, and people are now under our control. We need to take advantage of these to expand our economy and fully develop Siberia. Expanding firms and integrating them into our economy will surely give a boost to our GDP, which is necessary if we want Siberia to appear as a modern nation.\n\nUsing the Far East's industry, while limited, will be necessary if we want to compete with the industrialized West.

Their science base is also significantly powerful, with inventions and technological developments that surpass the world.\n\nFor all these reasons, we must ask America for aid! Our economy, science base, and military could all use American help. America must be on our side in the future, we don't know what conflicts lie ahead."

 ERS_modernist_all_that_weve_missed_desc:0 "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, innovation became a thing of the past. The only technological developments pertained to the military. Now that we have brought stability and democracy to Siberia, it's time we read up on the twenty years of science we missed. There is a lot to learn, and much of it can be used to improve the lives of the people.\n\nIn particular, developments in computer technology have gained the interest of our scientists. We need all the modern technology we can get our hands-on. If we do, we will far surpass any other backward nation in Russia."

 ERS_modernist_a_new_sibplan_desc:0 "The Russian Republic exists in the remains of Bukharin's Central Siberian Plan. The industrial development of the past allowed us to further expand Central Siberian infrastructure and cities. Now, however, it's time we begin the next phase of the plan.\n\nElectronics are the technology of the modern age. Our government has decided to create a city working towards the development of new technologies. Computers, telephones, radios, and even televisions could be designed and built in Russia! If there is a way to bring Russia into the modern age, it's technology!"

 ERS_modernist_theoretical_computer_science_desc:0 "Siberia has a plentitude of universities, its time they study electronics. Everything has to be taught, the assembly, programming, even theoretical sciences. Our scientists, professors, and researchers will have to work as hard as possible if we want to make Siberia into a center of technology for the world.\n\nIf all goes as planned, new electronics will be invented and discontinued within days. Each development will propel us further into the future, an age where everything is electronic."

 ERS_modernist_business_effort_desc:0 "If we want a chance at creating a Siberian electronic powerhouse, not everything can be done by the government. The private sector will be our most useful ally, with private companies competing with each other to create the best electronics Russia can come up with.\n\nHowever, we may have to help these private companies start up, planting the seeds if you will. Grants will be given to these new companies working in the computer and electronic fields. Hopefully, we should soon see some progress."

 ERS_modernist_importing_foreign_computers_desc:0 "Russia cannot develop reliable and well-functioning computers and electronics on its own. To give us a base to work with we will begin importing Sphere and American computers to figure out how they work and reverse engineer them.\n\nThis will give our engineers and theorists much-needed ideas to build and invent better computers. If all goes as planned, our computer scientists will be able to improve on American and Japanese designs, paving the way towards innovation."

 ERS_modernist_new_architectures_desc:0 "Vacuum tubes are good for computers, but they now seem to be a thing of the past. New, silicon chips are smaller and faster, allowing for even more advanced computer technology.\n\nA future for silicon chips in computer processors seems to be the way forward. We should experiment with silicon chips, perhaps our theorists or scientists could create an even better design! If not, we will still be able to prove the benefits of silicon circuits over vacuum tubes."

A technologically advanced military is a powerful military, and we need the best of the best if we want to win over our western rival and Germany.\n\nElectronics can be incorporated into tanks, planes, trucks, AFVs, and even support equipment. The best counter for a larger enemy is better technology. Their tanks and guns will be no match for ours!"

 ERS_modernist_financial_markets_desc:0 "Progress towards a Russian electronic powerhouse is steady but slow. Many companies working towards new inventions and developments for computers often find themselves low on cash necessary to continue their work.\n\nTheir failure means our failure. If we want to solve the funding issue, we have to funnel in more financial investments. Grants, donations, anything to get better results. As much money as possible must be pumped into developing electronics."

 ERS_modernist_west_where_we_must_return_desc:0 "The reunification of Russia is nearing, and we have to be ready for it. More men must be trained and deployed to the field, and our army size has to increase. A front against the west will be a large one, and we cannot allow any holes in our lines to appear. Deploying the army to the western border will guarantee our security in case of war, and will show our rival our might.\n\nAlthough, war may not be necessary. We should probably start off with negotiations before we prepare for any attack. Perhaps the West may be more willing to unify peacefully?"

 ERS_modernist_my_dolzhny_znat_my_budem_znat_desc:0 "We must know, we will know. Our republic has grown in the last decade. From a city to half a country we have so far brought democracy and freedom to the depths of this wasteland in which we reside. Our republic will only continue to expand until we have regained all of Russia, restoring liberty and democracy to what once was a land of darkness and despair.\n\nProgress and modernity are also within our reach, as new technologies are spread across Russia and people are brought out of their misery to thrive. All across Siberia hope, progress, and science are on the march. Let us bring it West."

 ERS_decembrist_last_of_the_reds_desc:0 "Our conquest of the Russian Far East may have granted us access to the outside world, but many radical Communists still remain in the region. These men are living remnants of the former Soviet Union, whose NKVD officers purged many of Russia's intellectuals before and during the German-Soviet War. We shall give these men no remorse just like they gave our intellectual friends no remorse; we must eradicate any shred of Communism remaining in the Russian Far East."
 ERS_decembrist_the_great_discord_desc:0 "Much of Pasternak's salon-based republic remains stained by political strife between different parties.

If we so choose, we have the power to act decisively and bolster our already growing industrial base by having a few chats with some of these entrepreneurs.\n\nOf course, doing so may help to illustrate the ridiculous narrative that we care more about factories and natural resources than we do about the political and material interests of our people, and we might be better off continuing to fight off the cynicism that pursuing reckless economic progress creates in the first place."
 ERS_decembrist_idealizing_the_center_desc:0 "Our end goal is to ultimately integrate everyone, within reason, into our political system. Independents of nearly all stripes should be encouraged to share their ideas and wishes not as outsiders, but with the Salon which most closely matches their personal ideology.\n\nWhile we cannot expect every single person to sort themselves cookie-cutter style into a Salon in an instant, and we can of course encourage some people to focus on things other than politics, we can definitely help people voice their grievances in a manner where they will actually be heard and where we will more readily be able to respond. It's a matter of practicality for us and for them."
 ERS_decembrist_a_new_school_of_thought_desc:0 "As a means of further integrating all sorts of people into our political system, we should encourage the formation and growth of new political philosophies at our universities and all across our realm with the ultimate aim of guiding these unique thinkers into one of our four Salons.\n\nEssentially, by both allowing and advocating for individuals to voice their own political thoughts, while simultaneously directing them subtly towards our existing system, we can strike a perfect balance; we'll demonstrate our flexibility and desire to listen to the people's will while still maintaining the status quo at the end of the day."
 ERS_decembrist_the_fractured_left_desc:0 "Soviets, anarchists, and assorted radical socialists alike all heavily populate some of our newly conquered territories. We are no fans of them. Or rather, we are opposed to their beliefs; hate the sin, love the sinner...\n\nStill, these misguided people are now our citizens and if we hope to integrate them into our Salon system and resolve this godforsaken political crisis, we at the very least need to hear what their grievances are and look like we are taking their wishes into account. Our Salons should be a place where people of all beliefs and all walks of life should be able to have their say, these folk are, unfortunately, no exception."
 ERS_decembrist_the_counter_reformation_desc:0 "Supporters of the ideas of Marx, Yagoda, and Sablin are all the same. Well, they're not literally the same, but for our purposes we can treat them as such.\n\nSocialism and communism are massive, grandiose ideologies that span a vast array of theories and ideals, and thinkers like Marx are just ordinary people like you and I. We can try and tame some of these radicals a bit and push them towards the Humanists' camp and away from damaging goals like revolution. While we are remiss to be directly supporting a rival Salon, doing so is decidedly preferable to allowing a bunch of leftists from collapsing our Salon system altogether."
 ERS_decembrist_forging_ahead_alone_desc:0 "The Decembrists were the ones who transformed a measly Tomsk into a strong and powerful Russia. We've already taken our republic this far, industrializing, reconquering, policymaking, developing our people's culture. Without our hard work and uniquely effective ideology and philosophy, we would be nothing. There is simply no time and no reason to ask the other Salons for assistance as we continue to move forward and put an end to the nation's political crisis. After all, we are the only Salon that is well and truly in touch with the wants, needs, and feelings of the Russian people."
 ERS_decembrist_the_great_symposium_desc:0 "A Salon system is no system at all without the input of dissenting ideas and collaboration from people of all different perspectives. We are going to fix the political mess we're in, but we're going to do it the right way: working together will all of the Salons to finally integrate everyone into our political machine.\n\nThe Humanists, Bastillards, and Modernists all have a role to play in definitively convincing the people that our way of running things is for the best. Not everyone wants or has to be a Decembrist, and we have come to a point where we can accept that for the good of Russia."

There is plenty of potential to be found in these new eastern provinces, and we must treat both man and nature with respect as we bolster the regional economy."
 ERS_decembrist_arms_for_the_soldiers_desc:0 "Our newly-conquered eastern lands and our Pacific border could be beneficial to our military development. We should use part of the acquired eastern resources to construct weapons for our liberation army. Now that we have a post on the Pacific, we can visit the outside world and discover new methods to develop stronger weapons, and who knows, we might be able to return with patents of our own."
 ERS_decembrist_bread_for_the_homefront_desc:0 "We are always in need of more food for our people, and it is imperative that we improve the current food situation in the conquered Far East.

 ERS_decembrist_a_visit_to_uncle_sam_desc:0 "Our entire governmental system was partly influenced by that of the United States, and many in our population look to the Americans as a true savior of democracy, a beacon of hope for the world. Now that we have expanded our influence to a large part of Russia, we have the opportunity to send our leaders to the United States. This is currently our best chance to establish a friendship with the Americans, and they may be able to assist us in creating a democratic Russian state."
 ERS_decembrist_a_new_far_eastern_fleet_desc:0 "Our expansion into Pacific territory requires us to gather whatever we have into a ragtag navy capable of ensuring our naval supply routes and defending our coast from invaders. We might be able to salvage what was left of the former Soviet navy or old warlord-era ships that remained in good condition. It would be our first step towards developing a competent Russian navy to patrol our coasts."
 ERS_decembrist_the_great_federation_desc:0 "Yes! We are inches away from being the one and only Russian Republic, but there is reason to celebrate even before the reunification is finalized. We're in a very strong position to be the nation doing the aforementioned reunifying, as our political crisis is at an end and we have developed the means to stand alone as a geopolitical force in our own right.\n\nWe have shown the world the light and power of democracy as we promised, and it is now time to spread freedom to all and drop bombs and roll tanks upon the tyrants of the world! For Russia, and for democracy!"

Finally no longer landlocked, we can begin to orchestrate trade across the ocean and finally bring foreign riches into Siberia.\n\nThis is a major achievement for the Bastillards especially. Our plan of free trade across the Pacific is finally possible. We have not just brought democracy to the Far East, but great wealth as well!"
 ERS_bastillard_harbins_dark_legacy_desc:0 "The legacy of communism is especially seen in Irkutsk and Buryatia. It is the Bastillard's duty to remove these red stains and ensure supplies can move freely between our ports and cities.

No bandit will reach our trade routes!"
 ERS_bastillard_the_red_hinterland_desc:0 "Harbin has a dark legacy in the Far East. The center of Russian Fascism, these groups thronged into Russia to destabilize it and enslave the Russian people. Fascism must be removed from the Far East for we cannot allow radical ideologies to tarnish our republic. Eliminating fascism from Outer Manchuria will also secure the ports, as we cannot have fascist resistance hurting our business efforts.\n\nIt is also important we conduct business in Harbin, as we must have ties with Japan so we do not rival them into the Pacific. A neutral relationship will be the best."
 ERS_bastillard_any_port_in_a_storm_desc:0 "Magadan is our only lifeline to the outside world, being the only major port under our control in the Far East. We must build more roads, more bridges, and more railways if we want Magadan to be as effective as possible, allowing us to transport goods and trade at a faster pace. Upgrading the port itself by building more docks and using new technologies will also be necessary if we want Magadan to be useful."
 ERS_bastillard_but_this_one_desc:0 "Even with our improvements to Magadan, the port will never be as good as Vladivostok or any other port in outer Manchuria. To get a more robust trade network with the outside world we must expand our diplomacy and political strength. The negotiations will be difficult, but failure could jeopardize our entire economy."
 ERS_bastillard_the_new_pacific_policy_desc:0 "To bring our project up off the ground a new Ministry will be created to oversee it, integrated into the government. Named the Ministry of Trade and Defense, it will focus solely on trade operations in the Far East and the Pacific as well as the defense of convoys and trade lines. Funding this new ministry will hopefully bring the right people to the table and progress our plans."
 ERS_bastillard_american_trade_desc:0 "Trade with America is absolutely critical if we want to have a strong economy. We will ask them to trade in Magadan, and while they may not like conducting trade in a port that is frozen half the year, perhaps giving them a bit more will pique their interest. Perhaps special treatment in our economy will do the trick."
 ERS_bastillard_open_the_port_by_any_means_desc:0 "The current lack of naval infrastructure makes trade a difficult and dangerous operation. The new Ministry of Trade and Defense will work to quickly construct and develop new ports and aquire ships. The legality of such an operation considering the dubious ownership of the land in up for debate, but we can hardly afford yet another set back. The operation will have to go ahead."
 ERS_bastillard_japanese_bargains_desc:0 "Japan now holds our old port of Vladivostok, which once was one of the best trading hubs in the Empire. We must ask them if we can make use of the port to trade and transport our goods. We could also request access to Manchurian railways which would give us the ability to send goods overland faster."
 ERS_bastillard_the_special_economic_zones_desc:0 "Manchuria may not be the best place to operate, but it is better than the Far East. Nevertheless, if we put our industries near the ports, the transportation of goods will go much faster and our economy will undoubtedly grow."
 ERS_bastillard_breaking_the_salon_deadlock_desc:0 "Dealing with Japan has proven very unpopular with both the citizens of the Republic and most of the Salons. However, there are those within one other salon that do understand our motives, the Humanists. Aligning ourselves with the Humanist salon should hopefully give us the majority to pass all the necessary policies dealing with America and Japanese trade."

 ERS.1.desc:0 "The President walked the halls of the Presidential Palace, alone at this late hour. None walked with him but his memories, echoes of a better time. Pale moonlight drifted through curtains of cloud in the sky, beaming through the hallway's grand windows.\n\nOnce, the Central Siberian Republic stood as one of the strongest successor states to the Soviet Union. Inheriting a wealth of industry from Bukharin's Siberian Plan, the government in Tomsk set to work rebuilding a new Russia, one where the citizens would be free to prosper, and free to give their opinion on governance. Yet the Russian Anarchy would not spare Central Siberia. Landlocked, and surrounded by hostile governments and warlords, the beginning of the Republic's end had come in from secessionists in Novosibirsk. Then, Yagoda's accursed Soviet Union remnants had launched its quixotic invasion. Both nations had been bled to death, its children weeping as war and famine came to once peaceful land. In Central Siberia various provincial governors rose against the fatally weakened central government. Rogue military officers had blamed the civilian government for their own failures to put out anarchists and secessionists. One by one, provinces seceded, until only Tomsk remained.\n\nThe cold tugged at Pasternak's energy. Almost as much as the damn disease did. The door to his office, wooden and regal, felt a little heavier every day. But the president was not about to throw in the towel yet. The CSR's old government had failed. Tomsk's current provisional government would not rule eternally. Pasternak felt he and his generation had gotten the Republic in this mess; the least they could do was do their best to give the next generation the torch. In the sleeping city surrounding the presidential palace, workers and poets, soldiers and politicians, all of the Republic's remaining children slept. All the president had to do, alone in his office as usual, was entrust the future to them. So much work to do, so little time. Pasternak chuckled. It wouldn't be long before he had all the sleep he needed, anyhow."

Now, the toll of illness and age were making such days a much more common occurrence. Boris Pasternak had thus spent the day reminiscing as he rest in his bedroom.\n\nHe had emerged as one of the early leaders of the old Central Siberian Republic. Things had never been easy, or evident. Some wanted a continuation of Bukahrin's Soviet Union. Others in the army preferred a much more authoritarian type of government, a permanent military emergency until the nation could be re-united. But Pasternak and his allies had appealed to the intellectuals of Tomsk, those who dreamed of a freer future. They had also appealed to the common man, promising to the worker prosperity in return for their help. Now the President found himself leader of a much reduced Republic, its democracy temporarily suspended by a provisional government, its economy in shambles. Time had made a mockery of these early plans.\n\nPasternak had been surprised to see the public back his continuation as emergency provisional president. Had he not embodied everything that had gone wrong with the CSR? Yet, the people in Tomsk had somehow kept their trust in him. Even the workers dutifully continued their shifts in the great industrial works, after having backed the provisional government in a referendum. The food situation was not excellent, but it was at least stable. Perhaps none among the poor or the elite wished to chance another leader in these most dangerous of times. General Shaposhnikov had ensured the loyalty of the rump army to civilian institutions.\n\nThe President felt a bit humbled by the trust shown to him. He also knew his people expected much in return. This did not worry him unduly; his final projects would soon be presented to Tomsk's leadership. Just as Pasternak had put his affairs in order before his passing, so too would the Republic's affairs be arranged."

Industrialists, academics, bureaucrats of the provisional government. A few outsiders stood awkwardly next to General Shaposhnikov. The trusty general had followed Pasternak's directives. The president nodded gratefully at his old friend. The general saluted, crisply. Pasternak began speaking: "Gentlemen, my time is probably more limited than yours, even." A few awkward laughs. Pasternak continued. "I've gathered you today to express my thoughts on the provisional government. I think none of us are particularly satisfied with its progress." A few nods of assent. "What was supposed to be a temporary measure to trim the old apparatus of the CSR, recalibrate our economy and tend to our diminished army has now stretched into months, and then years of sluggish progress. Political opposition has rightfully pointed out that without elections, our legitimacy is ever dwindling."\n\nPasternak sat at his chair, and addressed his attention to the outsiders. Mens of the salons, all, and not shy about partaging their thoughts on the provisional government. Good. "I've invited these gentlemen from the so-called Decembrist, Bastillard, Humanist and Modernist societies. Many good ideas have been discussed in the city's salons over the past few months. I've followed the renewal of the capital's cultural and political scene with much interest, and I believe it is now time to end the Provisional Government."\n\nA murmur threatened to boil into a debate. Pasternak rose a hand to silence it. "This will be done with good order, and a suitable new constitution will be implemented. Gentlemen, those secessionists and rebels have shown more daring than us, and have seized the moment. I believe it is time to do some mobilizing of our own, and tap into the great minds of the Republic to see it endure into the next generations.

In the middle of it all was the President, busy at work.\n\nIt was no easy feat to draft a constitution, even with the dozens of legal advisors who had been given their own section to work on. Harder still was what Pasternak had in mind: a living, breathing thing, in which all would see the Republic they envisaged. Pasternak's constitution would end the provisional government, and begin a new era in the Republic. An era of experimentation, an era of wild and crazy ideas. Pasternak's task was to avoid placing himself in the center stage. His duty was to build a theater where all sorts of players might enter and leave the Republic's political sphere, bringing in their own ideas and vision of the future. People would add on to the constitution, and remove some things. Yet in it would live a spirit, a spark of Pasternak's own dreams and failed ambitions.\n\nOn and on the work went. Occasionally a lawyer came in to discuss. In the afternoon a nurse administered the president his medicine for the day. Work progressed at a good pace. Every few days a compilation of recent ideas and changes was sent to advisors both within and without the provisional government.

I come to you personally to announce the end of the provisional government. In the aftermath of the great calamities that fell on the Republic, you came forward and granted us our request for an emergency provisional government. With this vote of confidence in hand, the government and I have blindly stumbled forward, like drunks holding onto a train ticket, afeared of losing it and being unable to reach their destination. I now realize that our greatest mistake was that we tried to shoulder on the burden of righting the ship of state all on our own. For this great arrogance, this government has found itself unable to leave the dark valley in which it has erred for the last few years, unable to lead its people to a better place."\n\n"The provisional government must end, and in its place the people must take up their role, act onto the power granted to them by our Republic.

Here and there a few radios kept them company, all of them humming a recording of Pasternak's speech dissolving the provisional government.\n\nTheir office had been one of the subcommittees of the provisional government's ministry of the industry. Diligently the men and women had counted what remained of the CSR's industrial assets, what had been lost to the rebels, and what needed to be done to stabilize the situation. In the end all their efforts had not amounted to much. The provisional government didn't have a lot of resources to be devoted to massive industrial redevelopment efforts. Better to maintain the slow decay than risk it all.\n\nNot all was lost, however. Their reports had been compiled into easy to digest analyses, and then spread to the public by the government itself.

It always saddened him to see the old composer reduced in health. No one was spared by time, after all. Both friends toasted, to their old homes in the west. To the streets of Saint Petersburg, to the alleyways of Warsaw. Both lost to the years, fascist jackboots keeping them drowning in the ebbs of time until even memories were dissolved.\n\nThe two friends did not particularly enjoy musing on painful memories. Yet, the fall of Europe cast their shadow on both musicians' lives. To this tragedy, Dmitry Shostakovich could find echo in the more recent catastrophe of the destruction of the Central Siberian Republic. A nation of hope and progress, crushed by militarism, its corpse embalmed by faceless bureaucrats and kept on display.\n\n"What is there to be done?" Asked Mieczysław. His mentor gazed into the distance, absent-mindedly pushing back up his glasses. Finally, the old composer spoke.\n\n"I've been discussing with fellows of the Humanist salon. I will run for Presidency." Anticipating his friend's objection, Shostakovich lifted his hand. "Ironic, isn't it? Even as the poor Pasternak has a foot in the tomb, I stand in line behind him with my own poor health. Yet, something must be done. The president is a good man, and his call for election is the right one. I'm afraid, Mieczysław. So many candidates running, none of them understand why the old Republic failed.

As the eldest son, it fell to Yevgeny to take care of his father in these final days.\n\nEven as life ebbed from him, his father's eyes glimmered with intelligence and determination. He often talked of regrets of the past, and of future dreams. More mundane topics, of course. What was becoming of the extended family? How was Yevgeny's own work going in the much reduced capital of the Republic? The son gently encouraged his father to worry less about others and more about himself. The older poet laughed. "Say, did I ever discuss with you why I picked Tomsk?" "Why you picked Tomsk, father?" "As capital." A coughing fit. "Ah!" Yevgeny thought for a moment. "No, you haven't. Why Tomsk"\n\n"Why indeed." Pasternak smiled wistfully. "Novosibirsk had more industry. Barnaul was an important railway junction, and held rich farmland. Yet I thought it could not be anywhere but Tomsk. Tomsk, so spared by the war." Another coughing fit wracked his father's body. "Tomsk, with its schools, and gymnasiums, its cafes and its theaters. How can you terrorize a people that is learned? How can one deny a nation its history when books and songs and poems carry forward a thousand generations?" Boris Pasternak's sentence trailed off, perhaps ending less crisply than he had desired. For a moment the dying man's determination faltered, and he sought his firstborn son's eyes for comfort. Yevgeny clutched his father's hand. "It was the right decision, papa. Russia will see justice and freedom within my lifetime. Now, you should rest. I will go fetch you your dinner."\n\nThe poet president nodded, leaned back into his bed.

Former general of the Central Siberian Republic Nikolay Krylov had seceded with several of the Republic's best infantry and mechanized divisions. The rich industrial town of Kemerovo and its coal basin had no doubt helped the separatists field several more regiments of well equipped troops. There were few good angle of attacks through the woods between staging point Yurga, and enemy capital Kemerovo.

Shaposhnikov had no idea if the rumors were true, no idea if his old friend had completely lost it after failing to defeat the anarchists in the east. All the Marshal knew is that for the Republic to live, Kemerovo's industrial assets had to be retaken.\n\nSome of Shaposhnikov's junior staff had expressed a mocking attitude toward the mad king and his lackeys. The Marshal had been quick to remind his officers not to underestimate any enemy. Crazy or not, General Krylov was a smart and charismatic leader.

Beyond the problem posed by high altitude fighting, Oyrotia's population was and had always been extremely low. Even with the influx of displaced old believers from western Russia, the tiny nation would struggle to field more than a few regiments of regular infantry. Beyond discussion of staging points for the invasion and a schedule aimed to acclimatize troops to mountain air, the military plan mostly discussed cultural issues tied to the occupation and how best to avoid making the locals feel as though their way of life is threatened.\n\nThe region had long been poor and semi-autonomous from the Central Siberian government. Local Burkhanists, follower of a turkic faith, had complained to the government about the arrival of thousands of old believer refugees from the west. The ever marginalized christian group had apparently decided on settling in a remote location for their own safety. Local tensions had been an issue, but not a critical one.

The invasion to recapture Krasnoyarsk from former Central Siberian Republic colonel Andreev and his acolytes.\n\nShaposhnikov detailed the opposition, as well strategic concerns for the invasion. The mutineers had chosen their location well; upon their betrayal of General Krylov, the rogue military units had seized the city of Krasnoyarsk on the Yenisei river. Recapturing the city would have been a dicey proposition for the failing CSR, forcing an attack upon both sides of the mighty river. The mutineers' hijacking of heavy guns meant to rout the anarchists had ensured that their position was all but unassailable, forcing Krylov to retreat in disgrace. The modern Republican army would be a far better match for Krasnoyarsk. Yet caution remained of the utmost importance.\n\nAfter giving his presentation, and listening to subsequent discussions, Shaposhnikov's thoughts went to Andreev. Personal disdain had no place in a commanding officer's mind. The Marshal of the Republic, however, hated Andreev and his mutineer. Not only had they cost the Republic dearly in blood and treasure, their betrayal had done much to send Krylov into a downward spiral. Not too long after his old friend had declared himself a king and began his mad reign. Shaposhnikov knew that as long as he and his men kept their calm, the rogue province would be recaptured.

After being routed by anarchist rebels, the thought of regrouping for another attempt to subdue the desperate population had broken the soldier's morale. Their act of rebellion against General Krylov had been meant to save Krasnoyarsk and the eastern territories from further bloodshed.\n\nUnfortunately for the mutineers, intercepted transmissions and letters that had predated the mutiny had been saved by fleeing CSR soldiers, and brought back to Tomsk. There, Andreev's duplicity had revealed itself; the coup had been long planned and organized from the top down. Ambitious military officers had lied to their men about Krylov's intentions. Once Krasonyarsk had been captured, a junta had ruled the fallen province, depriving the people of their freedoms. For this treason against the Republic and her people, the judge sentenced the mutiny's leaders to long prison sentences. Never again would armed men impose their dictats upon the population."

The room was unsurprisingly tense as the chief Modernist negotiator and his committee sat down across from the presidents and negotiators of the largest unions throughout the nation.\n\nThese discussions would be onerous, as they perfectly encapsulated the great dilemma the government had faced since coming into power: Tomsk needed to industrialize so that the separatists could be reclaimed and Central Siberia could reunify. The workers and unions were demanding better conditions and pay, but if such concessions were made now that might make it impossible for enough goods and munitions to be produced in time to secure Central Siberia, and thus the possibility to protect those workers' rights in the long term.\n\nIn addition to the demands being made by the unions was the pressure being exerted by the Decemberists and the Bastillards, who both more strongly emphasized the long-term solution of focusing on re-conquest. If the Modernists upheld the status quo and refused to make concessions, the other parties would surely increase their support of the government.\n\nUltimately, the primary demand being made by the unions was a reform of Tomsk's collective bargaining system to be fairer and more beneficial to the unionized workers. It was not an altogether unreasonable demand, and conceding to it would no doubt improve stability and workers' rights, but it did run the risk of making Tomsk weaker in a time where it especially needed to be strong.

It had not been a bad plan; a rapid push to cut in half the territory occupied by Anarchist rebels, and lay siege to the capital of Kansk where the Siberian Black Army's main headquarter could be found. Krylov's initial push had come close to doing the job. Andreev's betrayal had ensured that there would be no follow up offensives. In the Black Army's success in routing Krylov's heavy guns from the outskirts of Kansk, the final death of the Central Siberian Republic was determined. The anarchists had fought hard, and they had fought well. But this time, they would not face an exhausted Republican army.\n\nInformation sources on the SBA were hard to come by. The Republic's intelligence agency had still not determined how exactly the initial revolt had been sparked.

When their situation had grown impossible, however, the SBA had lost men as fast as melting spring snow. The Tomskian offensive, combined with Shaposhnikov's suggested land reforms and food delivery, had done much to peel away communes from the Black Army. The surrender of General Stepanov and his men had rendered the Black Army remnants into a determined insurrection. Tomsk's generals urged their men on, isolating hostile communes and slowly forming a grid of pacified territory within the region.\n\nThe capture of Councilor Krasnopevtev was the Republican army's highest priority, a culmination to the final campaign to eradicate anarchist ideology. The dedicated anarchist ideologue remained defiant to the end, unwilling to accept the offer of amnesty. Krasnopevtev died with his last companions, cornered in a forest safe house in the north. The men and women fought to the last bullet, refusing to grant their Republican foes any legitimacy. The martyrdom of Krasnopevtev echoed through the former free territory, and for a moment it seemed the insurrection might be sparked anew. But as loved as the councillor had been, the communes throughout the region were exhausted by a decade of conflict.\n\nThe Republican army took care to listen to their grievances, and brought food for the poorest. Perhaps their leader would have cast his judgement on them for willingly accepting servitude to the invading state. The peasants hoped the councillor would have found in himself the strength to forgive them.\n\nGeneral Stepanov's trial is due to begin soon. He is expected to argue that he merely wanted to protect local citizens from endless violence, as had all other captured separatists. In Tomsk, rumors abound of a reduced sentence meant to reward him for agreeing to end the bloodshed and give back to the eastern territories a sense of normalcy."

How foolishly short sighted.\n\nUnderestimating Vasilevsky and his Soviet Remnants had never been in question, however. Many observers had mocked the ambitions of the under armed Mongolian Red Army remnants and of the under strength light tank divisions that Vasilevsky had united in his PRC. Keeping a low profile, Vasilevsky had had the last laugh when his biggest rivals in the Far East and Central Siberia had torn themselves apart. This stay of execution had let the PRC thrive, and the tenacious red Soldiers had clung on to their land, even in the face of the almighty Sphere.\n\nTheir goal was admirable, of helping the mongols fight for their homeland, and of reforging a Soviet Union kinder to its peoples.

Some were inherited from the Soviet days. Others have grown from mistakes made during the Central Siberian government, and then in the days of the Provisional Government."\n\n"Chief among them is the state of the prison system.

Our rural citizens have been left forgotten by successive governments. Their way of life is under threat from urbanization and from the lure of industrial work. We need not cower from modernity.

Better rural infrastructure will help city folk develop their businesses, while giving new opportunities to their fellow citizens in the countryside."\n\n"This assembly will not always support this government's programs.

A patchwork of freight raillines had hastily been redirected to carrying wood back to the capital, through large detours in the Siberian forests.

Unfortunately, the road itself had always been little more than a dirt track, rendered unusable in the autumn and spring by mud.\n\nPavel had always been the one sent by the Lesosibirsk branch of his company to look for business partners in the capital.

Not an end to the old Russia, but a rational continuation of it. The Russian people had seen their liberties eroded by tsarism, and the heart of their tradition, the village community, trampled by the diktats of uncaring noble landlords.\n\nLikewise, the modern Decembrists seek to ensure Russian freedom. This time, from a different danger, the danger of industrialization. This is not to say that industry is a threat to the Russian way of life. Like many other western ideas, modern industry offers a great many things to the nation. However, it also brings with it threats. Chief among them are a twin headed beast : destruction of nature and the environment, the traditional cocoon in which Russian culture has grown; destruction of liberties, by governments or corporate interest tempted to brutally optimize the pursuit of material goods.\n\nThe Decembrists stand for freedom, citizens. Freedom to enjoy the environment of your forefathers. Freedom to earn a living decently, without industrial serfdom. Foreign from foreign tyrants, who seek to destroy our Republic.
